        <h3>16th Century Style</h3>
        <p>This style was inspired by the <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible"><span class="tag place geneva" id="geneva" data-coord="46.201667,6.146944">Geneva</span> Bible</span>, one of the most historically significant, widely read and influential translations of the Bible into English, preceding the <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version">King James Version</span> by 51 years. It was the  primary Bible of the 16th century English Protestantism, deemed to be the first "Study Bible" and was the one used and cited countless times by the likes of <span class="tag person william_shakespeare" id="william_shakespeare" data-name="William Shakespeare", data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</span>, <span class="tag person john_bunyan" id="john_bunyan" data-name="John Bunyan" data-name="John Bunyan" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bunyan">John Bunyan</span> and <span class="tag person john_milton" id="john_milton" data-name="John Milton" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton">John Milton</span>.</p>
        <p>The Geneva Bible is unique among all other Bibles offering a number of radical never-before-seen changes: it was the first Bible in English to add numbered verses, and it was also the first to include extensive commentary notes and study guides intended to help explain and interpret the Scriptures for the average reader. These aids were not only scriptural studies, but also included cross-reference verse citations, introductions to each book of the Bible, maps, tables, woodcut illustrations and indexes among other features.</p>

        <p>The Geneva Bible was first issued in a <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto">quarto</span> format, but later alternative editions were also issued in a pocketable <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavo">octavo</span> and a larger <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</span> versions. Following this formatting idea, the reading view of the application has been halved in two exact portions, the left one portraying the text of the article currently reading and the right portion (or "page", if you will) housing the "study aids" for the text in the form of an interactive map, the wikipedia portal and the alphabetically ordered index of the metadata.</p>

        <p>For what concerns the typography, the Geneva was the first Bible to introduce the easier-to-read “Roman Style Typeface” rather than the “Gothic Blackletter Style Typeface” which had been used exclusively in earlier Bibles. 
            With its variety of scriptural study guides and aids—which included cross-reference verse citations, introductions to each book of the Bible, maps, tables, woodcut illustrations, indexes, and other features—the Geneva Bible is regarded as history's first study Bible.

        <h3>1990s Style</h3>
        <p>The 1990s style was largely inspired by the work of <span class="tag person david_carson" id="david_carson" data-name="David Carson" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carson_(graphic_designer)">David Carson</span>, a pioneer in graphic design and surely one the most influential designers of the nineties. Nicknamed the “Godfather of Grunge”, Carson pioneered the use of distressed textures, layered backgrounds, and distinctively rough layouts and is seen as one of the most prominent figures that helped popularizing the grunge style, one of the defining styles of the time period.</p>
        <p>His style, known for pushing boundaries and challenging traditional design norms, is characterized by the use of deconstructive techniques that bend the rules of typography and layout resulting in very aggressive designs that push the laws of the discipline to the extreme.Carson’s work challenged the fundamental criteria for legibility by exploring elements such as reverse reading, extreme forced justification, and collage art styles.</p>

        <h2 class="pull-quote" style="font-size: 2rem;">“Just because something’s legible doesn’t mean it communicates the right thing. What is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material?”- David Carson</h2>
