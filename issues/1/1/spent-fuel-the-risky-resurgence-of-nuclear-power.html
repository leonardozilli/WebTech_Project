    <p> Last June, <span class="tag person gates" id="bill_gates" data-name="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</span> and reporters in <span class="tag place" id="cheyenne">Cheyenne</span>, <span class="tag place" id="wyoming">Wyoming</span>. “Fifteen years ago I assembled a group of experts . . . to solve the dual problems of global energy poverty and climate change,” the sweater-clad multibillionaire declared, speaking by video. “It became clear that an essential tool to solving both is advanced nuclear power.” But the technology, he continued, needed to become safer and less expensive. To this end, he had promised to invest $1 billion in <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>, a company he founded in <span class="tag date" id="2018">2018</span> to develop small modular reactors that can be churned out on an assembly line. He was now happy to announce the construction of a plant on the site of a defunct coal facility in <span class="tag place" id="wyoming">Wyoming</span>.</p>
    <p>Gates and other backers extoll the promise of <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>’s <span class="tag organization" id="natrium">Natrium</span> reactors, which are cooled not by water, as commercial U.S. nuclear reactors are, but by liquid sodium. This material has a high boiling point, some 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, which in theory enables the reactor to run at extreme temperatures without the extraordinary pressures that, in turn, require huge, expensive structures. “It’s smaller, cheaper, and inherently safe,” Jeff Navin, the director of external affairs at <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>, told me. </p>
    <p> As concern about climate change grows, nuclear power has gained new appeal, particularly on the left, for its promise as a supplement to wind and solar power in eliminating carbon dioxide emissions. What’s more, the prospect of cheaper and “safer” technology may relieve nuclear energy of unsavory historical baggage, notably the disastrous accidents at <span class="tag place" id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</span> in <span class="tag date">1986</span> and <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span> in <span class="tag date" id="2011">2011</span>. Early in her first term, Representative <span class="tag person ocasio-cortez" id="alexandria_ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</span> hailed the shutdown of the half-century-old <span class="tag building" id="indian_point">Indian Point</span> nuclear plant just north of <span class="tag place" id="new_york_city">New York City</span>, but cautioned that “one plant built decades ago is not emblematic of the technology that we have today,” adding that “the <span class="tag law" id="green_new_deal">Green New Deal</span> leaves the door open on nuclear.” She reiterated this position a year later, calling nuclear power “a critical part of this conversation,” even if “we have to make sure that the technology is vetted.” </p>
    <p> <span class="tag person chakrabarti" id="saikat_chakrabarti">Saikat Chakrabarti</span>, who helped draft the <span class="tag law" id="green_new_deal">Green New Deal</span> in <span class="tag date" id="2019">2019</span> as <span class="tag person ocasio-cortez" id="alexandria_ocasio-cortez">Ocasio-Cortez's</span> chief of staff, was less equivocal. “We took a tech-agnostic position on nuclear in the original deal because nuclear is such a polarizing issue,” he told me. But their internal analyses concluded that “there’s a big baseload problem that cannot be solved with wind and solar,” because they are intermittent. Acknowledging residual public fears, he insisted that “nuclear power is now extremely safe to operate, and the technology is improving all the time with these small modular reactors,” such as <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>’s design. </p>
    <p> “It’s generational,” observed Navin. “If you were active in the environmental movement in the Seventies, if you went through Three Mile Island”—the plant near <span class="tag place" id="harrisburg">Harrisburg</span>, <span class="tag place" id="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</span>, that sparked panic in <span class="tag date" id="1979">1979</span> when it began melting down—“you’re likely to be antinuclear today. But for young people concerned about the environment, anyone under thirty-five, it’s not an issue. The polls barely registered a blip over Fukushima.” The <span class="tag organization" id="sunrise_movement">Sunrise Movement</span>, a grassroots group founded in <span class="tag date">2017</span> to recruit an “army of young people” to fight climate change, has at times backed the idea of a hybrid grid that combines renewables and nuclear power. Even groups long noted for opposing nuclear power, such as the <span class="tag organization" id="union_of_concerned_scientists">Union of Concerned Scientists</span> and the <span class="tag organization" id="sierra_club">Sierra Club</span>, seem quietly ready to temporize on practical matters, such as allowing existing plants to continue as transitional energy sources. The “sobering realities” of climate change, wrote the <span class="tag organization" id="ucs">UCS</span>’s then president <span class="tag person kimmel" id="ken_kimmell">Ken Kimmell</span> in <span class="tag date" id="2018">2018</span>, “dictate that we keep an open mind about all the tools in the emissions reduction toolbox—even ones that are not our personal favorites.” As Navin put it, “the environmental movement has changed focus from local issues, such as protecting air and water, to climate change. That’s the driving focus, a realization that we have to move from climbing a lot of hills to climbing one very tall hill in a very short time.” He has no doubt that nuclear power, which he noted is currently generating half of all clean energy in the <span class="tag place" id="united_states">United States</span>, will play a central role in the path to a carbon-free future. </p>
    <p> The nuclear-power industry has long enjoyed establishment support. Navin was acting chief of staff at the <span class="tag organization" id="department_of_energy">Department of Energy</span> under <span class="tag person obama" id="barack_obama">Barack Obama</span>. The current energy secretary, <span class="tag person granholm" id="jennifer_granholm">Jennifer Granholm</span>, says that the <span class="tag organization" id="biden_administration">Biden Administration</span> plans to launch more nuclear energy projects across the country, and touts in particular <span class="tag organization" id="natrium">Natrium</span>’s promise of “345 megawatts of clean and affordable and reliable baseload power.” The <span class="tag organization" id="white_house">White House</span> climate czar, <span class="tag person mccarthy" id="gina_mccarthy">Gina McCarthy</span>, stresses the need to keep existing plants in operation, as well as the prospects for “these small nuclear reactors, these modular reactors,” in which “people are really investing significant resources.” The <span class="tag organization" id="state_department">State Department</span> has launched an effort to foster similar small reactor programs abroad. Most significantly, even amid bitter fights over the administration’s infrastructure and social-reform bills, the inclusion of $41 billion of industry subsidies in the legislation has received unquestioning bipartisan backing. “We’ve been getting quite a bit of attention from the administration and from <span class="tag organization" id="congress">Congress</span>,” Maria Korsnick, the president of the <span class="tag organization" id="nuclear_energy_institute">Nuclear Energy Institute</span>, told me. “I’m happy that the broader conversation has brought it round to recognition of the positive value of nuclear [for] the environment.” But the conversation needs to be much, much broader than that. </p>

    <p> <span class="tag person eisenhower" id="dwight_eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</span>’s “Atoms for Peace” program, unveiled in <span class="tag date" id="1953">1953</span>, set the optimistic tone for nuclear power: “The <span class="tag place" id="united_states">United States</span> knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future. The capability, already proved, is here today,” and would “rapidly be transformed into universal, efficient, and economic usage.” Four years later, <span class="tag place" id="moorpark">Moorpark</span>, a small town northwest of <span class="tag place" id="los_angeles">Los Angeles</span>, became the first American community to draw its electricity from a nuclear reactor. <span class="tag place" id="moorpark">Moorpark</span>’s power came from the <span class="tag building" id="sodium_reactor_experiment">Sodium Reactor Experiment</span>, operated by the <span class="tag organization" id="atomic_energy_commission">Atomic Energy Commission</span> at the <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana_field_laboratory">Santa Susana Field Laboratory</span> twenty miles away. The <span class="tag organization" id="aec">AEC</span>—a precursor to today’s <span class="tag organization" id="department_of_energy">Department of Energy</span>—invited <span class="tag person murrow" id="edward_r._murrow">Edward R. Murrow</span> to commemorate the event on his television show. “<span class="tag person fermi" id="enrico_fermi">Enrico Fermi</span> once looked at a reactor and said, ‘Wouldn’t it be wonderful if it could cure the common cold?’ ” intoned <span class="tag person murrow" id="murrow">Murrow</span>. “Here at <span class="tag place" id="moorpark">Moorpark</span>, a chain reaction that started with him washed the dishes and lit a book for a small boy to read.” No such lyrical announcement marked the day in Julywhen the plant’s coolant system failed and its uranium oxide fuel rods began melting down. With the reactor running out of control and set to explode, desperate operators deliberately released huge amounts of radioactive material into the air for nearly two weeks, making it almost certainly the most dangerous nuclear accident in U.S. history. The amount of iodine-131 alone spewed into the southern <span class="tag place" id="california">California</span> atmosphere was two hundred and sixty times that released at Three Mile Island, which is generally regarded as the worst ever U.S. nuclear disaster. None of this was revealed to the public, who were told merely that a “technical” fault had occurred, one that was “not an indication of unsafe reactor conditions.” As greater <span class="tag place" id="los_angeles">Los Angeles</span> boomed in the following years, the area around the reactor site—originally chosen for its distance from population centers—was flooded with new residents. No one informed them of the astronomical levels of radioactive contaminants seeded deep in the soil. </p>
    <p> Meanwhile, utilities were commissioning scores of nuclear plants across the country and promising electricity “too cheap to meter,” incentivized by the <span class="tag date">1957</span> Price-Anderson Act, which shifted financial liability in the event of a serious accident onto taxpayers. Rapid development throughout the Sixties engendered hopeful predictions from the <span class="tag organization" id="aec">AEC</span> that more than a thousand reactors would be operating in the <span class="tag place" id="united_states">United States</span> by the turn of the century. But it was not to be. As the environmental movement gathered strength in the Seventies, the dangers associated with nuclear power—from the routine disposal of radioactive waste to the risk of catastrophic meltdowns—galvanized a determined, informed, and organized opposition. Then, in <span class="tag date" id="1979">1979</span>, one of two reactors at Three Mile Island had a partial meltdown. Officials from the president on down issued soothing reassurances, downplaying the health risks. Negative assessments were discouraged; when the <span class="tag place" id="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</span> state health secretary, <span class="tag person" id="gordon_macleod">Gordon MacLeod</span>, criticized the state’s response, he was promptly fired by the governor. <span class="tag person" id="macleod">MacLeod</span> later revealed that child-mortality rates had doubled within a ten-mile radius of the plant. Cost overruns in plant construction, sometimes two times above industry estimates, were a further deterrent to expansion. Ultimately, more than 120 projects were canceled, and construction ground to a halt. “The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale,” <span class="tag organization" id="forbes">Forbes</span> magazine commented in <span class="tag date" id="1985">1985</span>, a year before <span class="tag event" id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</span>. “Only the blind, or the biased, can now think that most of the money has been well spent.” </p>

    <p> Amid the gloom, a distant ray of light for the industry began to flicker. On a hot day in June <span class="tag date" id="1988">1988</span>, the <span class="tag organization" id="nasa">NASA</span> scientist <span class="tag person" id="james_hansen">James Hansen</span> told a packed <span class="tag organization" id="senate">Senate</span> hearing, “with ninety-nine percent confidence,” that the earth’s temperature was at its warmest on record and that this was because of carbon dioxide emissions. By the following January, the <span class="tag organization" id="new_york_times">New York Times</span> was editorializing that the greenhouse effect is for real and calling for “a new generation of safer, cheaper nuclear power plants.” Later that year, <span class="tag person" id="hans_blix">Hans Blix</span>, the chairman of the <span class="tag organization" id="international_atomic_energy_agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</span>, told the <span class="tag organization" id="united_nations">United Nations</span> that “the public should be aware that nuclear energy emits . . . no carbon dioxide whatever.” Given this assumption (which discounts the enormous quantities of carbon dioxide generated during plant construction), nuclear power’s high cost could be offset by rewarding its low emissions. One way to limit pollution is to put a price on it, a point not lost on at least one farsighted industry executive. In <span class="tag date" id="1992">1992</span>, <span class="tag person" id="john_rowe">John Rowe</span>, then CEO of <span class="tag organization" id="new_england_electric_system">New England Electric System</span>, which owned several nuclear plants in the region, began making the case for carbon pricing as a response to climate change. </p>
    <p> Other partisans of nuclear power also recognized the relevance of climate alarms. This included <span class="tag person" id="alex_flint">Alex Flint</span>, a staffer for the <span class="tag place" id="new_mexico">New Mexico</span> senator <span class="tag person" id="pete_domenici">Pete Domenici</span>. <span class="tag person" id="flint">Flint</span> started working for <span class="tag person" id="domenici">Domenici</span> as a teenager and eventually rose to a position overseeing the billion-dollar budgets of the nation’s nuclear weapons laboratories, including <span class="tag building" id="los_alamos">Los Alamos</span> and <span class="tag building" id="sandia">Sandia</span>. (Other <span class="tag person" id="domenici">Domenici</span> staffers irreverently referred to his office as “the glow-in-the-dark team.”) By the mid-Nineties, <span class="tag person" id="flint">Flint</span> told me, scientists at the labs had convinced him “that the climate was changing, and we had a very serious problem.” </p>
    <p> In <span class="tag date" id="2000">2000</span>, following a traditional trajectory for well-connected congressional staffers, he moved over to the private sector as a lobbyist and quickly recruited an impressive list of nuclear-industry clients, including <span class="tag organization" id="exelon_corporation"><span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> Corporation</span>. <span class="tag person" id="john_rowe">John Rowe</span>, the apostle of carbon pricing, had just created <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> by merging two giant utilities with extensive holdings in nuclear and coal plants. <span class="tag person" id="rowe">Rowe</span> proceeded to sell off the coal operations, because, as he later explained, “I thought climate legislation would come sooner or later and that I’d rather have my money in the nuke fleet.” At the same time, <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> spent heavily on lobbying in <span class="tag place" id="washington">Washington</span>. Within ten years of its founding, the company had invested more than $35 million in such efforts. Unfortunately for <span class="tag person" id="rowe">Rowe</span>, the oil and gas industry had even deeper pockets and was viscerally opposed to any price penalty on its copious emissions. But <span class="tag person" id="rowe">Rowe</span>’s investment still yielded gratifying returns, most notably in the <span class="tag date">2005</span> Energy Policy Act. The bill authorized $13 billion in tax credits, plus additional loan guarantees, for new commercial reactors. This enormous bounty was crafted by none other than <span class="tag person" id="alex_flint">Alex Flint</span>, who had returned to public service as the staff director of the <span class="tag organization" id="senate_committee_on_energy_and_natural_resources">Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources</span>. (He then moved back to private employ the following year to head the <span class="tag organization" id="nuclear_energy_institute">Nuclear Energy Institute</span>’s governmental affairs office.) Money authorized under the act began to flow in <span class="tag date" id="2007">2007</span>, when <span class="tag organization" id="congress">Congress</span> appropriated $18 billion in loan guarantees for new reactors and another $4 billion for uranium enrichment. The largesse sparked hopes of a “nuclear renaissance” as utilities announced plans for new reactors. </p>
    <p> By then, climate change had moved to the forefront of public discussion. <span class="tag person" id="obama">Obama</span> spoke eloquently of the threat during his <span class="tag date">2008</span> campaign and urged a cap-and-trade initiative to curb carbon emissions. His close ties to <span class="tag place" id="chicago">Chicago</span>-based <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> were highlighted by bountiful campaign donations from <span class="tag organization" id="rowe">Rowe</span> and other executives, as well as the prior service of his chief strategist <span class="tag person" id="david_axelrod">David Axelrod</span> as a consultant for the company. One <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> lobbyist boasted of serving “the president’s utility.” But <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> was not alone in securing presidential favor. In February <span class="tag date" id="2010">2010</span>, <span class="tag person" id="obama">Obama</span> announced $8.3 billion in loan guarantees for two new reactors known as <span class="tag building" id="vogtle_3">Vogtle 3</span> and 4, to be built in <span class="tag place" id="burke_county">Burke County</span>, <span class="tag place" id="georgia">Georgia</span>. “We will not achieve a big boost in nuclear capacity,” declared the president, “unless we also create a system of incentives to make clean energy profitable.” As is traditional with the placement of such industrial facilities, the new reactors were to be constructed adjacent to a poor black community. The neighborhood, <span class="tag place" id="shell_bluff">Shell Bluff</span>, was already racked by cancers that residents ascribed to existing nuclear facilities. Not surprisingly, they vehemently opposed the project. “We voiced our opinion,” one local resident told <span class="tag organization" id="cnn">CNN</span>. “We didn’t want them, but we’re just the little peons.” The president, they said, “doesn’t know we’re down here.” </p>

    <p> Eleven years later, the <span class="tag place" id="vogtle">Vogtle</span> plants are still under construction. Originally slated to be finished in <span class="tag date" id="2017">2017</span>, they may now be ready in <span class="tag date" id="2023">2023</span>. Costs have soared from $14 billion to $27 billion, a hefty slice of the overrun being borne by electricity customers in <span class="tag place" id="georgia">Georgia</span>. Next door in <span class="tag place" id="south_carolina">South Carolina</span>, ratepayers are still seeing onerous supplements on their monthly bills for two plants that were abandoned in<span class="tag date" id="2017">2017</span>because of soaring costs and the bankruptcy of the main contractor. In November <span class="tag date"></span>, <span class="tag person" id="kevin_marsh">Kevin Marsh</span>, the former CEO of the <span class="tag place" id="south_carolina">South Carolina</span> utility <span class="tag organization" id="scana">SCANA</span>, pled guilty to fraud in concealing the $9 billion cost of the uncompleted reactors. He is now serving a two-year prison sentence. </p>
    <p> Passing off additional costs to utility customers would appear to be a standard business model. It tends to require the complaisance of state legislators, who can demand and receive a high price for their favors—unseemly transactions that call into question the notion of “clean” nuclear energy. In November <span class="tag date" id="2016">2016</span>, senior executives at <span class="tag place" id="ohio">Ohio</span>’s <span class="tag organization" id="firstenergy">FirstEnergy</span> hatched plans to shunt more of the operating costs of their two nuclear plants onto individual customers. As later detailed by an <span class="tag organization" id="fbi">FBI</span> criminal complaint, the scheme involved lubricating the election of a cooperative Republican legislator named <span class="tag person" id="larry_householder">Larry Householder</span> as speaker of the <span class="tag place" id="ohio">Ohio</span> House of Representatives. To this end, $61 million moved via a series of dark money cutouts to <span class="tag person" id="householder">Householder</span>, who used the funds both for personal needs and for financing his campaign and those of allies who could supply the necessary votes for the rate increase. It proved a sound investment. <span class="tag person" id="householder">Householder</span> was duly elected speaker and proceeded to pass a bill in <span class="tag date" id="2019">2019</span>, with bipartisan support, that authorized $1 billion in rate supplements to bail out the company’s two <span class="tag place" id="ohio">Ohio</span> plants. (One of these, <span class="tag organization" id="davis-besse">Davis-Besse</span>, outside <span class="tag place" id="toledo">Toledo</span>, has a hair-raising safety record, including a hole in the reactor vessel and cracks in its concrete containment shell.) Although the bill canceled existing mandates for renewable energy, proponents were eloquent in their concern for the climate. Representative <span class="tag person" id="jamie_callender">Jamie Callender</span>, for example, who got just under $25,000 from <span class="tag organization" id="firstenergy">FirstEnergy</span> and served as a primary sponsor of the bill, spoke piously of the need to encourage “zero carbon emissions.” A <span class="tag organization" id="firstenergy">FirstEnergy</span> spokesman applauded <span class="tag person" id="callender">Callender</span> and other sponsors “for their efforts in recognizing the important and vital role nuclear energy, along with many other clean energy sources, plays in providing clean, safe, and reliable carbon-free energy to Ohioans.” </p>
    <p> Unfortunately for the plotters, the <span class="tag organization" id="fbi">FBI</span> had monitored their deliberations. Following disclosure of the bribery scheme, public outrage led to a repeal of the bailout. Householder, indicted along with four associates, denies the charges and has yet to go to trial. <span class="tag organization" id="firstenergy">FirstEnergy</span>, none of whose employees faced criminal charges, agreed to a $230 million fine, and its generating unit was spun off under the name <span class="tag organization" id="energy_harbor">Energy Harbor</span>. (“We call it <span class="tag organization" id="pirates’_cove">Pirates’ Cove</span>,” joked the <span class="tag place" id="toledo">Toledo</span> attorney <span class="tag person" id="terry_lodge">Terry Lodge</span>, who has been litigating cases related to <span class="tag organization" id="davis-besse">Davis-Besse</span> since <span class="tag date" id="1979">1979</span>.) </p>
    <p> While <span class="tag organization" id="energy_harbor">Energy Harbor</span> saw its scheme collapse, <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> has suffered no such setback in pursuit of bailouts through similar means. A federal investigation revealed that an <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> subsidiary lavished favors in the form of jobs and contracts on associates of <span class="tag place" id="illinois">Illinois</span> <span class="tag organization" id="house">House</span> Speaker <span class="tag person" id="mike_madigan">Mike Madigan</span>, long the most powerful politician in the state, and was rewarded with beneficial legislation, most notably a $2.35 billion subsidy enacted in <span class="tag date" id="2016">2016</span>, for two money-losing reactors that the company had discussed closing. The subsidiary agreed to pay a $200 million fine, which was more than balanced by the $694 million subsidy signed into law by <span class="tag person" id="j._b._pritzker">J. B. Pritzker</span> in September <span class="tag date" id="2021">2021</span>, a response to <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span>’s threats to close two other aging plants—one of which appears to have generated a significant cancer cluster in its neighborhood. Though the <span class="tag organization" id="sierra_club">Sierra Club</span> opposes nuclear energy, the <span class="tag place" id="illinois">Illinois</span> chapter supported that legislation because of the measures it included to phase out coal and gas sources. The <span class="tag place" id="illinois">Illinois</span> bailout is far eclipsed, however, by the federal largesse promised by the <span class="tag organization" id="biden_administration">Biden Administration</span>’s infrastructure and climate legislation. An analysis by the <span class="tag organization" id="nuclear_information_and_resource_service">Nuclear Information and Resource Service</span> suggests that 54 percent of the $41 billion will be split between just three companies, with <span class="tag organization" id="exelon">Exelon</span> set to receive $15 billion. (<span class="tag organization" id="energy_harbor">Energy Harbor</span> is the runner-up, with $5 billion.) </p>
    <p> For all the hopeful talk about new technology, however, the industry’s principal concern is to keep aging reactors running long after their original life spans, even where this poses serious safety risks. In a process known as embrittlement, for example, vital components such as containment vessels crack following decades of neutron bombardment, leading to the release of lethal radiation. Nonetheless, the <span class="tag organization" id="nuclear_regulatory_commission">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span> appears happy to grant extensions: plants originally designed to last forty years are being authorized to run for sixty or eighty in total. Point Beach 2, a reactor on Lake Michigan that the <span class="tag organization" id="nrc">NRC</span> itself listed in <span class="tag date">2013</span> among the most embrittled plants in the country, is applying to be relicensed to operate for eighty years. The reactor and its twin, <span class="tag building" id="point_beach_1">Point Beach 1</span>, have been cited for safety violations and equipment malfunctions more than 130 times. At the <span class="tag organization" id="nrc">NRC</span>, there is even discussion of allowing plants to run for a century, long after their designers and builders are dead. “None of these extreme extensions have addressed critical ‘knowledge gaps’ for the reliability of major irreplaceable and inaccessible systems,” said <span class="tag person" id="paul_gunter">Paul Gunter</span> of <span class="tag organization" id="beyond_nuclear">Beyond Nuclear</span>, a tireless watchdog group working to challenge the extensions. In his view, the industry is being allowed to head blindly into the unknown, with no idea how or when age-related cracking and embrittlement will lead to component failure and potential meltdown. </p>

    <p> Prosperous and 70 percent white, <span class="tag place" id="west_hills">West Hills</span>, <span class="tag place" id="california">California</span>, is one of the communities that have sprouted near the <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana_field_laboratory">Santa Susana Field Laboratory</span> in the decades since the <span class="tag date">1959</span> meltdown. Unlike the poor, sick, and embittered residents of <span class="tag place" id="shell_bluff">Shell Bluff</span>, people living in <span class="tag place" id="west_hills">West Hills</span> had until recently only the barest inkling that nuclear power in the neighborhood might have had unwelcome consequences. “Almost no one knew about the <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana_field_lab">Santa Susana Field Lab</span>, or they thought it was an urban legend,” <span class="tag person" id="melissa_bumstead">Melissa Bumstead</span>, who grew up in nearby <span class="tag place" id="thousand_oaks">Thousand Oaks</span>, told me recently. In <span class="tag date" id="2014">2014</span>, <span class="tag person" id="bumstead">Bumstead</span>’s four-year-old daughter, <span class="tag person" id="grace">Grace</span>, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia. “This has no environmental link,” her pediatric oncologist told her firmly. Childhood cancers were rare, and this was just cruel luck. Then, while taking <span class="tag person" id="grace">Grace</span> to <span class="tag organization" id="children’s_hospital">Children’s Hospital</span> <span class="tag place" id="los_angeles">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="tag person" id="bumstead">Bumstead</span> ran into a woman who recognized her from the local park where their young daughters played. The woman’s child had neuroblastoma, another rare cancer, as did another from nearby Simi Valley, whom they encountered while the children were getting chemo. Back at home, someone on her street noticed the childhood cancer awareness sticker on <span class="tag person" id="bumstead">Bumstead</span>’s car and mentioned that another neighbor had died of cancer as a teenager. <span class="tag person" id="bumstead">Bumstead</span> began to draw a map detailing the cluster of cancer deaths in small children just in the previous six years, but stopped working on it in <span class="tag date" id="2017">2017</span>. “I had such severe PTSD when I added children onto it, my therapist told me to stop.” But it is still happening, she said, mentioning the unusual number of bald children she had noticed in local elementary schools in recent years, as well as the far-above-average rate of breast cancer cases recorded in the area. A cleanup of the field lab was due to be completed in <span class="tag date" id="2017">2017</span>, but it has yet to begin. </p>
    <p> I called <span class="tag person" id="bumstead">Bumstead</span> because I had been struck by the fact that <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>’s <span class="tag product" id="natrium">Natrium</span> reactor resembles in its basic features the long-ago <span class="tag building" id="sodium_reactor_experiment">Sodium Reactor Experiment</span> at <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana">Santa Susana</span>. (<span class="tag product" id="natrium">Natrium</span> is Latin for sodium.) “That’s exactly what we had!” <span class="tag person" id="bumstead">Bumstead</span> exclaimed when I mentioned that liquid sodium is integral to <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>’s project. “The meltdown was in the sodium reactor.” As her comment made clear, such liquid sodium technology is by no means innovative. Nor, in an extensive history of experiments, has it ever proved popular—not least because liquid sodium explodes when it comes into contact with water, and burns when exposed to air. In addition, it is highly corrosive to metal, which is one reason the technology was rapidly abandoned by the <span class="tag organization" id="u.s._navy">U.S. Navy</span> after a tryout in the <span class="tag product" id="seawolf">Seawolf</span> submarine in <span class="tag date" id="1957">1957</span>. That system “was leaking before it even left the dock on its first voyage,” recalls <span class="tag person" id="foster_blair">Foster Blair</span>, a longtime senior engineer with the <span class="tag organization" id="navy">Navy</span>’s reactor program. The <span class="tag organization" id="navy">Navy</span> eventually encased the reactor in steel and dropped it into the sea 130 miles off the coast of <span class="tag place" id="maryland">Maryland</span>, with the assurance that the container would not corrode while the contents were still radioactive. The main novelty of the <span class="tag product" id="natrium">Natrium</span> reactor is a tank that stores molten salt, which can drive steam generators to produce extra power when demand surges. “Interesting idea,” <span class="tag person" id="blair">Blair</span> commented. “But from an engineering standpoint one that has some real potential problems, namely the corrosion of the high-temperature salt in just about any metal container over any period of time.” </p>
    <p> <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span>’s <span class="tag person" id="jeff_navin">Jeff Navin</span> assured me in response that <span class="tag organization" id="natrium">Natrium</span> “is designed to be a safe, cost-effective commercial reactor.” He added that <span class="tag organization" id="natrium">Natrium</span>’s use of uranium-based metal fuel would increase the reactor’s safety and performance. <span class="tag person" id="blair">Blair</span> told me that such a system had been tried and abandoned in the Fifties because the solid fuel swelled and grew after fissioning. </p>
    <p> In a March <span class="tag date" id="2021">2021</span> report for the <span class="tag organization" id="union_of_concerned_scientists">Union of Concerned Scientists</span>, the physicist <span class="tag person" id="edwin_lyman">Edwin Lyman</span> likewise concluded that there was little evidence that reactor designs like <span class="tag product" id="natrium">Natrium</span>’s would be safer than water-cooled models. “When I read about many of the current proposals,” <span class="tag person" id="blair">Blair</span> said, “it is almost as if they are unaware of all the work that has gone before.” Citing the <span class="tag organization" id="navy">Navy</span>’s abandonment of sodium reactors, he suggested that companies such as <span class="tag organization" id="terrapower">TerraPower</span> “are unaware, or intentionally choose to ignore history.” He recalled that Admiral <span class="tag person" id="hyman_rickover">Hyman Rickover</span>, who ran the <span class="tag organization" id="navy">Navy</span>’s nuclear program for three decades, would personally command the sea trials of every new nuclear submarine. In that spirit, he suggested, “they should only license a small modular reactor on condition that the head of the corporation that built it takes up permanent residence within a quarter mile of the plant.” </p>
    <p> As the sodium saga indicates, the true history of nuclear energy is largely unknown to all but specialists, which is ironic given that it keeps repeating itself. The story of <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana">Santa Susana</span> follows the same path as more famous disasters, most strikingly in the studious indifference of those in charge to signs of impending catastrophe. The operators at <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana">Santa Susana</span> shrugged off evidence of problems with the cooling system for weeks prior to the meltdown, and even restarted the reactor after initial trouble. Soviet nuclear authorities covered up at least one accident at <span class="tag place" id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</span> before the disaster and ignored warnings that the reactor was dangerously unsafe. The <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span> plant’s designers didn’t account for the known risk of massive tsunamis, a vulnerability augmented by inadequate safety precautions that were overlooked by regulators. Automatic safety features at <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana">Santa Susana</span> did not work. This was also the case at <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span>, where vital backup generators were destroyed by the tidal wave. </p>
    <p> No one knows exactly how much radiation was released by <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana">Santa Susana</span>—it exceeded the scale of the monitors. Nor was there any precise accounting of the radioactivity released at <span class="tag place" id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</span>. <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span> emitted far less, yet the prime minister of <span class="tag place" id="japan">Japan</span> prepared plans to evacuate fifty million people, which would have meant, as he later recounted, the end of <span class="tag place" id="japan">Japan</span> as a functioning state. Another common thread is the attempt by overseers, both corporate and governmental, to conceal information from the public for as long as possible. <span class="tag building" id="santa_susana">Santa Susana</span> holds the prize in this regard: its coverup was sustained for twenty years, until students at <span class="tag organization" id="ucla">UCLA</span> found the truth in <span class="tag organization" id="atomic_energy_commission">Atomic Energy Commission</span> documents. </p>
    <p> Most striking of all is the success of official campaigns asserting that even the most serious accidents have caused little or no harm. The spectacular scale of the <span class="tag event" id="chernobyl_disaster">Chernobyl disaster</span>, with its mass evacuations and radioactive clouds wafting across borders, made it difficult to downplay health effects. Yet, as <span class="tag person" id="kate_brown">Kate Brown</span>, a historian of science at <span class="tag organization" id="mit">MIT</span>, details in Manual for Survival: An Environmental History of the Chernobyl Disaster, the <span class="tag organization" id="international_atomic_energy_agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</span> and the <span class="tag organization" id="world_health_organization">World Health Organization</span> helped promote the notion that the disaster’s health effects had been minimal. In <span class="tag date" id="2005">2005</span>, the <span class="tag organization" id="un">UN</span> settled on a figure of 4,000 deaths among those most exposed in <span class="tag place" id="ukraine">Ukraine</span>, <span class="tag place" id="belarus">Belarus</span>, and <span class="tag place" id="russia">Russia</span>—a number at the low end of a strikingly wide range, <span class="tag person" id="brown">Brown</span> observed. The <span class="tag organization" id="iaea">IAEA</span> had earlier reported “no health disorders that could be attributed directly to radiation exposure.” It was only when <span class="tag person" id="keith_baverstock">Keith Baverstock</span>, a scientist with the <span class="tag organization" id="world_health_organization">World Health Organization</span>, defied a superior and publicly disclosed a sharp increase in extremely rare thyroid cancers among Belarusian children that there was some grudging acceptance of the disaster’s deadly consequences. Even so, <span class="tag person" id="baverstock">Baverstock</span> says, he was threatened with firing unless he withdrew his findings; others in receipt of <span class="tag organization" id="who">WHO</span> funding claimed the jump in cases was merely the result of intensified screening. </p>
    <p> <span class="tag person" id="brown">Brown</span> spent ten years in archives across <span class="tag place" id="ukraine">Ukraine</span>, <span class="tag place" id="belarus">Belarus</span>, and <span class="tag place" id="russia">Russia</span>, disinterring records of what happened to the millions of people exposed not only to the invisible cloud, but to its residue in the landscape from which they drew their food. That residue had global reach—a truck carrying Ukrainian blueberries to the <span class="tag place" id="united_states">United States</span> from <span class="tag place" id="canada">Canada</span> was so radioactive it was stopped at the border. Traveling around affected areas, some far from the plant itself, <span class="tag person" id="brown">Brown</span> encountered evidence of communities shredded by radiation, such as women who sorted wool from sheep slaughtered in the radiation zone. Toting bales of radioactive wool, <span class="tag person" id="brown">Brown</span> has said, “was like hugging an X-ray machine while it was turned on over and over again.” Many got sick and died. Yet amid the tens of thousands of pages <span class="tag person" id="brown">Brown</span> perused, just one obscure official document furnished a hard figure for <span class="tag place" id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</span>-related deaths: 36,525. That was the number of women in <span class="tag place" id="ukraine">Ukraine</span> who received pensions because their husbands had died as a result of the disaster—a toll far in excess of anything reported by Western officials. But that stark number must represent only a small fraction of the total. “That’s just <span class="tag place" id="ukraine">Ukraine</span>,” she told me, “which received only 20 percent of the radiation. There’s no comparable figure for <span class="tag place" id="belarus">Belarus</span>, which got far more.” </p>
    <p> While <span class="tag person" id="brown">Brown</span> mined records of <span class="tag place" id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</span>’s effects on humans, <span class="tag person" id="timothy_mousseau">Timothy Mousseau</span> of the <span class="tag organization" id="university_of_south_carolina">University of South Carolina</span> and his Danish colleague <span class="tag person" id="anders_møller">Anders Møller</span> spent decades studying its consequences on the landscape around the plant. “It’s not a complete void of life. It’s much more insidious than that,” <span class="tag person" id="mousseau">Mousseau</span> told <span class="tag organization" id="harper’s_magazine">Harper’s Magazine</span> in <span class="tag date" id="2011">2011</span>. “Because everything’s still there, it’s just being modified at some low level.” Birds, animals, and plants suffer the baneful effects of radiation to some degree. Early on, <span class="tag person" id="mousseau">Mousseau</span> was struck by the near absence of spiderwebs, normally abundant in forests. Studying the area around <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span>, he saw many of the same results. This conclusion was not popular with the Japanese authorities. “One reason we don’t know as much about <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span> as we should,” he told me, “is that the Japanese—the government, academia, the corporation, it’s all the same thing—really discouraged research. I was certainly pressured not to publish my findings. It was in the form of sticks and carrots, carrots being, ‘Wouldn’t it be nice to have an institute for studies of <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span>, and by the way, you really don’t want to publish those papers that you’ve written recently.’” He published them anyway. </p>
    <p> In light of the evidence of <span class="tag event" id="post-chernobyl_thyroid_cancer">post-Chernobyl thyroid cancer</span>, researchers mounted a major effort to screen children in the area around <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span>. Year after year, the numbers steadily ratcheted up, eventually reaching twenty times normal levels. (As with thyroid cancer in <span class="tag place" id="belarus">Belarus</span>, officials from <span class="tag organization" id="un">UN</span> agencies claimed the rise in cases was merely the result of intensified screening.) Meanwhile, local authorities began a campaign to discourage children from getting screened, advising them of “the right not to know.” The campaign had some success, and the number of participating children dropped. Not coincidentally, from <span class="tag date">2016</span> on, the number of reported child thyroid cases started to decline. </p>
    <p> “The right not to know” about the effects of nuclear power is currently embraced far beyond <span class="tag place" id="fukushima">Fukushima</span>. In the face of escalating alarm about climate change, the siren song of “clean and affordable and reliable” power finds an audience eager to overlook a business model that is dependent on state support and often greased with corruption; failed experiments now hailed as “innovative”; a pattern of artful disinformation; and a trail of poison from accidents and leaks (not to mention the 95,000 tons of radioactive waste currently stored at reactor sites with nowhere to go) that will affect generations yet unborn. Arguments by proponents of renewables that wind, solar, and geothermal power can fill the gap on their own have found little traction with policymakers. Ignoring history, we may be condemned to repeat it. <span class="tag person" id="bill_gates">Bill Gates</span> has bet a billion dollars on that. </p>
