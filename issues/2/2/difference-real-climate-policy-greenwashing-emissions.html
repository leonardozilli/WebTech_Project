        <p>So it’s goodbye climate deniers, hello – and you’ll pardon me for being blunt here – climate bullshitters.</p>
        <p>The impacts of the <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate emergency</span> are now so obvious, only the truly deluded still deny them. Instead, we are at the point where everyone agrees <!----><span class="tag opinion">something must be done, but many are making only vague, distant promises of ineffective action</span>. As a result, we are currently on track for a 0.5% cut in <span class="tag concept emissions">global emissions</span> from <span class="tag date 2010" id="2010">2010</span> levels by <span class="tag date 2030" id="2030">2030</span>, when a 45% drop is needed to avoid climate catastrophe.</p>
        <p>So how to spot this <span class="tag concept greenwashing">greenwash</span>? <!---->A good rule of thumb is whether the proposal actually cuts <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span>, by a significant amount, and soon, and whether the proposer is in fact making the <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate emergency</span> worse elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Let’s start at the top, with the world’s governments, which have been setting out more targets than an archery competition. The global leader is the <span class="tag place country united_kingdom" id="united_kingdom">UK</span>, which recently pledged a world-beating <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span> cut of 78% by <span class="tag date 2035" id="2035">2035</span>. Targets are a necessary first step, but need action to be met and the instant, universal response: “Show me the policies!”</p>
        <p>The problem is some actual <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span> policies are pushing <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span> up, not down: massive road building, a scrapped home energy efficiency programme and slashed electric car incentives, new <span class="tag concept oil">oil</span> and <span class="tag concept gas">gas</span> exploration, a failure to halt airport expansions and block a new <span class="tag concept coal">coalmine</span>  (instead, the government belatedly ordered a public inquiry).</p>
        <p>But it is not just <span class="tag person boris_johnson" id="boris_johnson" data-name="Boris Johnson" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</span>’s government that says one thing while doing another. All are talking tough on climate, but <span class="tag place country china" id="china">China</span> is building one large coal-fired power station a week, <span class="tag place country japan" id="japan">Japan</span> remains one of the biggest financiers of overseas <span class="tag concept coal">coal</span> plants and <span class="tag place country norway" id="norway">Norway</span> is developing giant new <span class="tag concept oil">oil</span> and <span class="tag concept gas">gas</span> fields.</p>
        <p><span class="tag place country canada" id="canada">Canada</span>’s premier <span class="tag person justin_trudeau" id="justin_trudeau" data-name="Justin Trudeau" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</span> says <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate change</span> is an “existential threat”, yet the country’s <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span> have actually increased since the <span class="tag date 2015" id="2015">2015</span> <span class="tag event paris_climate_deal">Paris deal</span>, thanks to its tar sands exploitation. Oh, and many nations still subsidise <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuels</span>, which is like buying more cigarettes when you’re trying to quit smoking.</p>
        <p>The world’s forests are suffering because of the same doublespeak. <span class="tag place country indonesia" id="indonesia">Indonesia</span>, the <span class="tag place country democratic_republic_of_the_congo" id="democratic_republic_of_the_congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span class="tag place country peru" id="peru">Peru</span> and <span class="tag place country colombia" id="colombia">Colombia</span> all pledged in <span class="tag date 2014" id="2014">2014</span> to end <span class="tag concept deforestation">deforestaiton</span> by <span class="tag date 2030">2030</span>. Yet in official carbon-cutting pledges submitted to the <span class="tag organization u_n"  >UN</span> since then, none have confirmed that commitment.</p>
        <p>Companies are, if anything, even better bullshitters than governments, and the <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuel</span> giants are masters. Many are still exploring for new reserves, when we already have more than can ever be safely burned.</p>
        <p><span class="tag organization chevron">Chevron</span> touts capturing <span class="tag concept emissions">CO2 emissions</span> and storing them underground as a solution – one that of course enables the continued burning of its products. But its plans for carbon capture and storage cover less than 1% of its <span class="tag date 2019" id="2019">2019</span> c<span class="tag concept emissions">arbon emissions</span>. <span class="tag organization exxon">ExxonMobil</span> wants public money to help with its carbon capture project to store 50m tonnes of CO2 by <span class="tag date 2030">2030</span>. That’s just 8% of the <span class="tag date 2020">2020</span> <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span> its products resulted in.</p>
        <p>Another technological fix promoted is hydrogen, in theory a clean fuel when generated using <span class="tag concept renewables">renewable energy</span>. But its most enthusiastic backers are incumbent <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuel</span> companies. Members of the global <span class="tag organization hydrogen_council">Hydrogen Council</span> include <span class="tag organization saudi_aramco"> Saudi Aramco</span>, <span class="tag organization bp">BP</span> and <span class="tag organization total">Total</span>, while the <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span> parliament’s hydrogen group is funded by <span class="tag organization shell">Shell</span> and <span class="tag concept gas">gas</span> network and boiler-making firms.</p>
        <p>Why? Because hydrogen is a way for <span class="tag concept oil">oil</span> companies to move towards <span class="tag concept green_politics">green energy</span> without giving up <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuels</span>. <span class="tag person pierre_etienne_franc" id="pierre_etienne_franc" data-name="Pierre-Etienne Franc">Pierre-Etienne Franc</span>, co-secretary of the <span class="tag organization hydrogen_council">Hydrogen Council</span> until <span class="tag date 2020">2020</span>, explained: “It’s a way to avoid having stranded assets from the current <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuel</span>-based system.”</p>
        <p>Heating homes currently produces 14% of <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span> <span class="tag concept emissions">carbon emissions</span> and finding a green alternative is a major challenge. But hydrogen is a “very poor solution”, says one clean energy expert, <span class="tag person michael_liebreich" id="michael_liebreich" data-name="Michael Liebreich" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Liebreich">Michael Liebreich</span>, and should only be considered for heavy industry, and perhaps aviation and shipping, sectors where using electricity directly or via batteries is near impossible.</p>
        <p><span class="tag organization sse">SSE</span> is one of the <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span>’s biggest electricity suppliers and a “major partner” of the crucial <span class="tag event un_cop26">UN Cop26</span> climate summit that the <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span> is hosting. It is also the only company currently building a new <span class="tag concept gas">gas</span> power plant in the <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span>. Then there is <span class="tag organization drax">Drax</span>, which receives huge subsidies for burning wood in its power station. It insists this is climate-friendly – many scientists and environmentalists disagree.</p>
        <p><span class="tag organization drax">Drax</span> proposes in future to add carbon-capture capability to its wood-burning power station, <!---->suggesting this would mean CO2 was being removed from the atmosphere, via trees and plants. But to work on the global scale some envisage, this approach would require an estimated 0.4 to 1.2bn hectares of land – 25% to 80% of the cropland that currently feeds the world. <span class="tag organization wwf">WWF</span> and other NGOs recently walked out on the <span class="tag organization european_commission">European Commission</span> after the bloc’s “disastrous” decision to label bioenergy as sustainable.</p>
        <p>Next up, big banks – their financing of <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuels</span> was bigger in <span class="tag date 2020">2020</span> than in <span class="tag date 2016" id="2016">2016</span> or <span class="tag date 2017" id="2017">2017</span>, after the <span class="tag event paris_climate_deal"><span class="tag event paris">Paris</span> climate deal</span>. Top of the pile is <span class="tag organization jpmorgan_chase">JPMorgan Chase</span>, despite it launching a “Paris-aligned financing strategy” and “aiming to finance and facilitate” $1tn in green initiatives by <span class="tag date 2030">2030</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="tag organization barclays">Barclays</span> and <span class="tag organization bnp_paribas">BNP Paribas</span> both became founding members of the <span class="tag organization u_n"  >UN</span>-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance last month, yet both are in the top 10 financiers of <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuels</span> since <span class="tag date 2015">2015</span>. Over at <span class="tag organization blackrock">BlackRock</span>, the world’s biggest investor and a company that says <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate change</span> is a “global threat”, its “Carbon Transition Readiness” fund includes <span class="tag organization chevron">Chevron</span>, <span class="tag organization exxon">ExxonMobil</span> and other <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuel</span> giants.</p>
        <p>Now let’s turn to carbon <span class="tag concept offset">offsets</span>, which many companies proffer as a way to claim future <span class="tag concept climate_neutrality">climate neutrality</span>. An alarm bell should already be ringing when long-term <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate-change</span> sceptic <span class="tag person nigel_farage" id="nigel_farage" data-name="Nigel Farage" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage">Nigel Farage</span> is getting into the <span class="tag concept offset">offset</span> business.</p>
        <p><span class="tag concept offset">Offsets</span> sound good in theory, but too often are fantasy accounting. Planting trees is a popular idea, but even if every possible new tree on the planet took root and started sucking up carbon, they would still be overwhelmed by <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuel</span><span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="tag organization shell">Shell</span> is keen on <span class="tag concept offset">offsets</span> – 120m tonnes by <span class="tag date 2030">2030</span> – while <span class="tag organization nestlé">Nestlé</span>’s goal of <span class="tag concept offset">offsetting</span> 13m tonnes of CO2 a year with “nature-based solutions” would require 4.4m hectares of land a year, according to <span class="tag organization ngo_grain">NGO Grain</span> – about the size of <span class="tag place country denmark">Denmark</span>. Still, <span class="tag organization kitkats">KitKats</span> will be carbon neutral by <span class="tag date 2025">2025</span>, the company says, so that’s nice.</p>
        <p>Even <span class="tag organization u_n">UN</span> climate finance envoy and former <span class="tag organization bank_of_england">Bank of England</span> governor <span class="tag person mark_carney" id="mark_carney" data-name="Mark Carney" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Carney">Mark Carney</span> recently tripped up over <span class="tag concept offset">offsets</span>. <!---->He claimed that the investment company he vice-chairs was “net zero” despite investing in <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fossil fuels</span> because the company also invested in <span class="tag concept renewables">renewable energy</span>. Some called that an “accounting trick”. I call it a pile of rubbish.</p>
        <p>Aviation companies are also prime purveyors of green guff. <span class="tag organization ryanair">Ryanair</span> boasted before the <span class="tag concept corona_virus">pandemic</span> that its CO2 per passenger kilometre was the lowest in Europe, neglecting to mention that its growth in passengers meant its total <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span> were rising.</p>
        <p><span class="tag place city london">London City</span> is among the many airports claiming to be carbon neutral – actual flights not included. And <span class="tag company british_airways">British Airways</span>’ owner has just pledged to powering 10% of its flights with sustainable aviation <span class="tag concept fossil_fuels">fuel</span>  by <span class="tag date 2030">2030</span>, a date by which the world must halve <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span>. Meanwhile, the <span class="tag place country united_kingdom">UK</span> is set to cut taxes on domestic flights – contrast that with <span class="tag place country france" id="france">France</span>, which is banning short internal flights.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the worst transport offender is the shipping industry. In <span class="tag date 2020" id="2020">November 2020</span>, the <span class="tag organization international_maritime_organization">International Maritime Organization</span>, which says it is <!---->“contributing to the global fight against <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate change</span>” sealed a deal that allows <span class="tag concept emissions">emissions</span> to increase until <span class="tag date 2030">2030</span>.</p>
        <p>I could talk next about the giant meat companies – such as the one promising to end its <span class="tag concept deforestation">deforestaiton</span>, but not for 14 years – or the motor or tech industries, but I think you’ve got the picture by now.</p>
        <p>So what to make of it all? Don’t think there is no real climate action: <span class="tag concept renewables">renewable energy</span> and electric cars are accelerating rapidly. And companies’ pledges can sometimes be impressive, for example <span class="tag organization burger_king">Burger King</span> committing to less meat and more plants in the patties it serves up.</p>
        <p>But until every government and corporate decision has to pass the bullshit test – does it really cut carbon now – then we are kidding ourselves if we think we are treating the <span class="tag concept climate_change">climate crisis</span> like the emergency it is.</p>
