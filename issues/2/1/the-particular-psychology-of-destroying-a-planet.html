    <p>Two weeks ago, I looked at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/climate-anxiety-makes-good-sense">the question of the anxiety</a> that the <span class="tag concept">climate crisis</span> is causing our psyches. But, if you think about it, there’s an equally interesting question regarding the human mind: <!--potrebbe essere uno dei topic-->How is it that some people, or corporations, can knowingly perpetuate the damage? Or, as people routinely ask me, “Don’t they have grandchildren?”</p>
    <p>A reminder that plenty of people have been engaged in this kind of planetary sabotage came last week in a remarkable <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(21)00233-5">paper</a> by <!--Harvard lo marchi come un posto o come un'istituzione-->Harvard’s <span class="tag person">Geoffrey Supran</span> and <span class="tag person">Naomi Oreskes</span>. After analyzing nearly two hundred sources, including some internal company documents and “advertorials,” they concluded that <span class="tag company">Exxon</span> officials had embraced a strategy <span class="tag opinion">“that downplays the reality and seriousness of <span class="tag concept">climate change</span>, normalizes fossil fuel lock-in, and individualizes responsibility.”</span> And the authors found a model: <span class="tag opinion">“These patterns mimic the tobacco industry’s documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations—which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms—and onto consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry’s use of demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation, regulation, and activism.”</span> As <span class="tag person">Supran</span> explains in a long Twitter <a hrf="https://twitter.com/GeoffreySupran/status/1392869611310354432">thread</a> about the research, “<span class="tag company"> Exxon</span> tapped into <!--questo ha senso marcarlo come posto?--><span class="tag opinion"><span class="tag place">America</span>’s uniquely individualist culture and brought it to bear on <span class="tag concept">climate change</span>.”</span></p>
    <p>What kind of thinking goes into adopting a tobacco-industry strategy to protect a business model as you wreck the climate system? (And it’s not just <span class="tag company">Exxon</span>—here’s an <a hrf="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-meat-industry-is-doing-exactly-what-big-oil-does-to-fight-climate-action/2021/05/14/831e14be-b3fe-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html">analysis</a> of how <!-- puo essre un tag industry-->Big Meat is playing the same climate tricks.) No one, of course, can peer inside the heads of oil-company executives or those of their enablers in the legal, financial, and political worlds. But there’s an interesting explanation in a new book from the British psychoanalyst <span class="tag person">Sally Weintrobe</span>. <!--span class="tag book"????-->“<a hrf="https://www.amazon.com/Psychological-Roots-Climate-Crisis-Exceptionalism/dp/1501372866?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=a4c5ae0f-11fc-4cf2-8c8&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50">Psychological Roots of the Climate Crisis</a>” states its argument in its subtitle: “<span class="tag concept">Neoliberal Exceptionalism</span> and the Culture of Uncare.” <span class="tag person">Weintrobe</span> writes that people’s psyches are divided into caring and uncaring parts, and the conflict between them “is at the heart of great literature down the ages, and all major religions.” <span class="tag opinion">The uncaring part wants to put ourselves first</span>; it’s the narcissistic corners of the brain that persuade each of us that we are uniquely important and deserving, and make us want to except ourselves from the rules that society or morality set so that we can have what we want. “Most people’s caring self is strong enough to hold their inner exception in check,” she notes, but, troublingly, “ours is the <span class="tag opinion">Golden Age of <span class="tag concept">Exceptionalism</span>.” <span class="tag concept">Neoliberalism</span> — especially the ideas of people such as <span class="tag person">Ayn Rand</span>, enshrined in public policy by <span class="tag person">Ronald Reagan</span> and <span class="tag person">Margaret Thatcher</span>—“crossed a Rubicon in the 1980s” and neoliberals “have been steadily consolidating their power ever since.” <span class="tag person">Weintrobe</span> calls leaders who exempt themselves in these ways “exceptions” and says that, as they “drove <span class="tag concept">globalization</span> forwards in the 1980s,” they were captivated by an ideology that whispered, “Cut regulation, cut ties to reality and cut concern.” <span class="tag person">Donald Trump</span> was the logical end of this way of thinking, a man so self-centered that he interpreted all problems, even a global pandemic, as attempts to undo him. “The self-assured neoliberal imagination has increasingly revealed itself to be not equipped to deal with problems it causes,” she writes.</p>
    <p>In her conclusion, <span class="tag person">Weintrobe</span> contrasts this narcissistic entitlement with the “lively” (and psychologically appropriate) entitlement of young people who are now demanding climate action so that they will have a planet on which to live full lives. “They, who will have to live in a damaged world, need our support to stop further damage,” she writes. “The danger is that unless we break with <span class="tag concept">Exceptionalism</span> and mourn our exaggerated sense of narcissistic entitlement, we may pay them lip service with kind words but throw them overboard . . . while we carry on with carbon-intensive life as usual.”</p>
    <h2>Passing the Mic</h2>
    <p>The film <span class="tag movie">“The Ants and the Grasshopper”</span> has been a long time in the making. In 2012, <span class="tag person">Raj Patel</span>, a research professor at the <!--institution???-->University of Texas, went to <span class="tag place"><span class="tag place">Malawi</span></span> with a film crew to follow the farmer and activist <span class="tag person">Anita Chitaya</span> and document her work in ending hunger and gender inequality. “We wanted to show that the biggest innovations in the food system were being driven by frontline communities and people of color in the global South,” <span class="tag person">Patel</span> said. But, “when <span class="tag person">Anita</span> learned about <span class="tag concept">climate change</span>, and the role of the <!--span class="tag "????--> United States in furthering it, she was shocked. She asked whether she should come over to <span class="tag place">America</span>, to school us on what <span class="tag concept">climate change</span> was doing to her community. We fund-raised, travelled in <span class="tag date">2017</span>, and documented the impact she had on communities from <span class="tag place">Iowa</span> to <span class="tag place">Detroit</span> to <span class="tag place">Oakland</span> to <span class="tag place">Washington, D.C.</span>”</p>
    <p>The film about that trip—charming, infuriating, big-hearted—will début later this month at the <!-- span class="tag event"-->Mountainfilm documentary festival, in <span class="tag place">Telluride, Colorado</span>. You can watch the trailer <a>here</a>, and it’s worth doing to get a sense of <span class="tag person">Chitaya</span>’s voice so that you can imagine her answering these questions, which <span class="tag person">Patel</span> and his team forwarded to her in <span class="tag place">Africa</span>. (They translated the answers from her native Tumbuka, and the interview has been edited.)</p>
    <p>What message were you most trying to get across to Americans when you travelled here?</p>
    <p>The atmosphere has been damaged because of gas and smoke coming from <span class="tag place">America</span>. We came to spread the news about how <span class="tag concept">climate change</span> affects us in <span class="tag place"><span class="tag place">Malawi</span></span>, and what we are doing to change how we live to address the problems. We needed to tell them about the struggles that we were facing because it seems they did not know and, if they did not know about us, how could they care about us? I also want to say that it was an honor for us to meet them.</p>
    <p>What do you think they heard, and what do you think they didn’t hear?</p>
    <p>A lot of people listened and nodded when we talked about <span class="tag concept">climate change</span> in <span class="tag place">Malawi</span>, but many also didn’t understand. <span class="tag opinion">They agreed that the weather was different, but disagreed that it was something that was the result of humans</span>. They said it was impossible for humans to do this to the weather, or said that it was God’s will. This means that, even if their hearts were touched when we told them of our suffering, they did not understand that the way they live is causing that suffering.</p>
    <p>If those <span class="tag place">Midwest</span> farmers came to your community and your farm, what would you like them to learn from the experience?</p>
    <p>I would be very happy if they came to my farm. I would teach them how we return the stalks and residue to the soils, how we plant soybeans and add manure from animals to heal the soil. If we take care of the soil, it will yield, and our lives can be healthy, without malnutrition.</p>
    <p>But I would also show them how far we have to walk for water. In <span class="tag place">America</span>, you have so much water. Here, our boreholes are drying up for longer each year. For us, it can be that it takes an hour to walk for water, and then you have to wait in a queue. I would show them how <span class="tag concept">climate change</span> makes life harder for women. If men don’t understand <span class="tag concept">gender equality</span> here, it makes life harder for their wives and daughters, who have to walk farther to find water.</p>
    <p>And I would show them how men and women share work here. We have Recipe Days, when men and boys learn to cook, and everyone learns to experiment with new kinds of food. It helps us to bring about <span class="tag concept">gender equality</span>. We did not see as much of that in <span class="tag place">America</span> as we do in our villages. Some people in <span class="tag place">America</span> have a very traditional view of what men and women should do. If we are to work together, <!-- non èinteso come place-->America needs to let go of its backward thinking.</p>
    <h2>Climate School</h2>
    <p>The biggest news of the week was Tuesday’s report from the <span class="tag institution">International Energy Administration (I.E.A.)</span> explaining that, to have any chance of meeting the temperature target set in the <!-- non come posto ma come event-->Paris accord, new development of coal, gas, and oil has to cease now. This epochal statement will be reverberating for weeks. (I wrote about it here.) For now, this interview with the <span class="tag institution">I.E.A.</span> executive director, <span class="tag person">Fatih Birol</span>, gets the message across concisely. Putting new money into fossil fuel, <span class="tag person">Birol</span> said, would be “junk investments.”</p>
    <p>The fight over the <!--????-->Line 3 pipeline—which activists conducted as best they could during a long pandemic winter in <span class="tag place">Minnesota</span>—is slowly nationalizing. The <span class="tag institution"><span class="tag place">Seattle</span> City Council</span> voted to oppose the pipeline plan, becoming the first non-tribal government to do so. Meanwhile, activists announced plans for what looks to be a large gathering bent on nonviolent direct action along the pipeline route in <!--date???-->June. Success would probably require making Line 3 enough of a national issue that the <!--administration come???--><span class="tag person">Biden</span> Administration feels the need to intervene. Meanwhile, Governor <span class="tag person">Gretchen Whitmer</span>, of <span class="tag place">Michigan</span>, offers an impassioned defense of her efforts to shut down the <!---->Line 5 oil pipeline through the <span class="tag place">Great Lakes</span>.</p>
    <p>Department of I Didn’t See That Coming: A new report shows that rising carbon-dioxide <span class="tag concept">emissions</span>  are lowering the density of the upper atmosphere and, in the process, could reduce the amount of space junk normally incinerated as it begins to return toward Earth. In a worst-case scenario, the amount of satellite-killing debris in orbit could increase fifty times by <!---->2100—a “more probable outcome” is a tenfold or twentyfold increase.</p>
    <p>The <!--span class="tag jornal???-->Guardian’s environment editor <span class="tag person">Damian Carrington</span> offers a handy taxonomy for figuring out what’s <span class="tag concept">greenwashing</span> and what’s real progress.</p>
    <p>In <span class="tag place">Sunset Park, Brooklyn</span>, community leaders, including <span class="tag person">Elizabeth Yeampierre</span>, of uprose, were part of a push toward a new clean-energy model for the waterfront, through the development of an offshore wind project. Now, such a project will be built by the Norwegian oil company <span class="tag company">Equinor</span>. As <!--jurnal-->Inside Climate News reports, the waterfront’s “73 acres of cracked concrete and rusting fences will be cleared away and replaced with the modern port that will anchor the burgeoning offshore wind industry. Crumbling bulkheads will be shored up to support 200-foot cranes. The decrepit piers, which look out over <span class="tag place">Lower Manhattan</span> and the <!--???-->Statue of Liberty, will be reinforced to hold turbine blades as long as football fields.”</p>
    <p><span class="tag place">Tasmania</span> was one of the birthplaces of <span class="tag concept">green politics</span>, and <span class="tag person">Christine Milne</span>, a former senator from the <!--party??-->Australian Greens party, is hard at work restoring <span class="tag place">Lake Pedder</span>, which was vastly expanded in the nineteen-seventies by flooding from a huge hydroelectricity project. As she makes clear in this video, the ancient glacial lake is a prime candidate for restoration to its original state, as the <span class="tag event"><span class="tag institution">United Nations’</span> Decade on Ecosystem Restoration’</span>, which will run through 2030, commences.</p>
    <p>Together with the activist pranksters the <!---->Yes Men and the Fixers Fix, the young climate campaigners of <!--???-->Fridays for Future pulled a prank on the <span class="tag institution"><span class="tag place">U.K.</span> ’s Standard Chartered Bank</span> , though it’s sad that a declaration from a bank that it will stop funding <span class="tag conocept">fossil fuels</span>  is more likely to be a spoof than reality.</p>
    <p><span class="tag place">Brentwood, California</span>  — which is about fifty miles east of <span class="tag place">Berkeley</span>  — decided not to renew a franchise for a pipeline that runs through a corner of the city. Council members and residents, the <!---->Mercury News reported, “had many questions concerning safety of the pipeline that flows 1.8 million cubic feet of natural gas daily through the city, including near several subdivisions, which were not built at the time the pipeline was constructed. ‘I’ll be honest, I have concerns,’ Councilwoman <span class="tag person">Jovita Mendoza</span>  said. ‘It’s right by school, and that makes me super uncomfortable.’ ”</p>
    <h2>Scoreboard</h2>
    <p>A new study finds that a third of global food production may be at risk by century’s end if greenhouse-gas <span class="tag concept">emissions</span>  keep rising at a rapid rate. But, if we meet the targets set in the <!---->Paris accord, only five to eight per cent of our harvests may be in danger.</p>
    <p>Pressure is building on the investment giant <span class="tag company">T.I.A.A.</span>  to divest from <span class="tag conocept">fossil fuels</span> . The asset manager, which handles the pensions of many teachers and university professors, has more clients in the <!---->State University of <span class="tag place">New York</span>  system than any other university—and last week members of the University at Albany’s faculty senate followed the lead of their colleagues on other campuses and voted to ask <span class="tag company">T.I.A.A.</span>  to get out of <span class="tag conocept">fossil fuels</span> .</p>
    <p>A new paper from the <!---->Carbon Tracker initiative in <span class="tag place">London</span>  shows that, contrary to a downbeat assessment from the <span class="tag institution">International Energy Agency</span> , there’s enough easily available lithium and other minerals to keep the <span class="tag concept">renewables</span>  boom going—and that the switch from <span class="tag conocept">fossil fuels</span>  should dramatically decrease the total amount of mining activity on the planet. It appears to answer many of the concerns raised in a <!---->Wall Street Journal op-ed on the same topic.</p>
    <p>Amid the tragic fighting in the <span class="tag place">Middle East</span> , the outgoing (Jewish) and incoming (Muslim) executive directors of the <span class="tag institution">Arava Institute</span> , perhaps the region’s leading environmental-studies center, issued a plea for peace and for joint work on larger issues. “Instead of turning our attention to the common threats we face from a pandemic still out of control in <span class="tag place">Gaza</span>  and the <span class="tag place">West Bank</span> , the economic fallout from the pandemic, and the looming impact of <span class="tag concept">climate change</span>, we find ourselves embroiled once again in violence and the historic political conflict. We call on the <span class="tag institution">government of <span class="tag place">Israel</span> </span>  to prevent further violent escalation and implore leaders in the region to reject a return to tribalism and find a path towards peace, reconciliation, security, justice and self-determination for all.”</p>
    <h2>Warming Up</h2>
    <p><span class="tag person">Bettye LaVette</span> ’s version of “Blackbird” is killer anytime, but, just to remind ourselves that people aren’t the only ones with a stake in the climate outcome, here’s an old video of the ecologist <span class="tag person">Curt Stager</span>  playing the same song—for a black bird. It will make you grin.</p>
    <p><span class="tag person">Bill McKibben</span>  is the founder of Third Act, which organizes people over the age of sixty for progressive change, and a contributing writer to <!---->The New Yorker. His latest book is “The Flag, the Cross, and the Station Wagon: A Graying American Looks Back at His Suburban Boyhood and Wonders What the Hell Happened.”</p>
