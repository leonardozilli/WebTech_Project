      <h3>The risky resurgence of nuclear power</h3>

      <p>
        Last June, <span class="person">Bill Gates</span> addressed a crowd of
        politicians and reporters in
        <span class="place">Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>. “Fifteen years ago I
        assembled a group of experts . . . to solve the dual problems of global
        energy poverty and climate change,” the sweater-clad multibillionaire
        declared, speaking by video. “It became clear that an essential tool to
        solving both is advanced nuclear power.” But the technology, he
        continued, needed to become safer and less expensive. To this end, he
        had promised to invest $1 billion in
        <span class="company">TerraPower</span>, a company he founded in
        <span class="date">2018</span> to develop small modular reactors that
        can be churned out on an assembly line. He was now happy to announce the
        construction of a plant on the site of a defunct coal facility in
        <span class="place">Wyoming</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="person">Gates</span> and other backers extoll the promise
        of <span class="company">TerraPower</span>’s Natrium reactors, which are
        cooled not by water, as commercial U.S. nuclear reactors are, but by
        liquid sodium. This material has a high boiling point, some 1,600
        degrees Fahrenheit, which in theory enables the reactor to run at
        extreme temperatures without the extraordinary pressures that, in turn,
        require huge, expensive structures. “It’s smaller, cheaper, and
        inherently safe,” <span class="person">Jeff Navin</span>, the director
        of external affairs at <span class="company">TerraPower</span>, told me.
      </p>

      <p>
        As concern about climate change grows, nuclear power has gained new
        appeal, particularly on the left, for its promise as a supplement to
        wind and solar power in eliminating carbon dioxide emissions. What’s
        more, the prospect of cheaper and “safer” technology may relieve nuclear
        energy of unsavory historical baggage, notably the disastrous accidents
        at Chernobyl in <span class="date">1986</span> and Fukushima in <span class="date">2011</span>. Early in her
        first term,
        Representative
        <span class="person">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</span> hailed the shutdown
        of the half-century-old Indian Point nuclear plant just north of
        <span class="place">New York City</span>, but cautioned that “one plant
        built decades ago is not emblematic of the technology that we have
        today,” adding that “the Green New Deal leaves the door open on
        nuclear.” She reiterated this position a year later, calling nuclear
        power “a critical part of this conversation,” even if “we have to make
        sure that the technology is vetted.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="person">Saikat Chakrabarti</span>, who helped draft the
        Green New Deal in <span class="date">2019</span> as <span class="person">Ocasio-Cortez</span>'s
        chief of staff, was less equivocal. “We took a tech-agnostic position on
        nuclear in the original deal because nuclear is such a polarizing
        issue,” he told me. But their internal analyses concluded that “there’s
        a big baseload problem that cannot be solved with wind and solar,”
        because they are intermittent. Acknowledging residual public fears, he
        insisted that “nuclear power is now extremely safe to operate, and the
        technology is improving all the time with these small modular reactors,”
        such as <span class="company">TerraPower</span>’s design.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s generational,” observed <span class="person">Navin</span>. “If you
        were active in the environmental movement in the Seventies, if you went
        through Three Mile Island”—the plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that
        sparked panic in <span class="date">1979</span> when it began melting down—“you’re likely to be
        antinuclear today. But for young people concerned about the environment,
        anyone under thirty-five, it’s not an issue. The polls barely registered
        a blip over Fukushima.” The
        <span class="organization">Sunrise Movement</span>, a grassroots group
        founded in <span class="date">2017</span> to recruit an “army of young people” to fight climate
        change, has at times backed the idea of a hybrid grid that combines
        renewables and nuclear power. Even groups long noted for opposing
        nuclear power, such as the
        <span class="organization">Union of Concerned Scientists</span> and the
        <span class="organization">Sierra Club</span>, seem quietly ready to
        temporize on practical matters, such as allowing existing plants to
        continue as transitional energy sources. The “sobering realities” of
        climate change, wrote the UCS’s then president
        <span class="person">Ken Kimmell</span> in <span class="date">2018</span>, “dictate that we keep
        an open mind about all the tools in the emissions reduction toolbox—even
        ones that are not our personal favorites.” As
        <span class="person">Navin</span> put it, “the environmental movement
        has changed focus from local issues, such as protecting air and water,
        to climate change. That’s the driving focus, a realization that we have
        to move from climbing a lot of hills to climbing one very tall hill in a
        very short time.” He has no doubt that nuclear power, which he noted is
        currently generating half of all clean energy in the United States, will
        play a central role in the path to a carbon-free future.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nuclear-power industry has long enjoyed establishment support.
        <span class="person">Navin</span> was acting chief of staff at the
        Department of Energy under <span class="person">Barack Obama</span>. The
        current energy secretary, <span class="person">Jennifer Granholm</span>,
        says that the Biden Administration plans to launch more nuclear energy
        projects across the country, and touts in particular Natrium’s promise
        of “345 megawatts of clean and affordable and reliable baseload power.”
        The White House climate czar, <span class="person">Gina McCarthy</span>,
        stresses the need to keep existing plants in operation, as well as the
        prospects for “these small nuclear reactors, these modular reactors,” in
        which “people are really investing significant resources.” The State
        Department has launched an effort to foster similar small reactor
        programs abroad. Most significantly, even amid bitter fights over the
        administration’s infrastructure and social-reform bills, the inclusion
        of $41 billion of industry subsidies in the legislation has received
        unquestioning bipartisan backing. “We’ve been getting quite a bit of
        attention from the administration and from Congress,”
        <span class="person">Maria Korsnick</span>, the president of the
        <span class="organization">Nuclear Energy Institute</span>, told me.
        “I’m happy that the broader conversation has brought it round to
        recognition of the positive value of nuclear [for] the environment.” But
        the conversation needs to be much, much broader than that.

      <p>
        <span class="person">Dwight Eisenhower</span>’s “Atoms for Peace”
        program, unveiled in <span class="date">1953</span>, set the optimistic tone for nuclear power:
        “The United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no
        dream of the future. The capability, already proved, is here today,” and
        would “rapidly be transformed into universal, efficient, and economic
        usage.” Four years later, <span class="place">Moorpark</span>, a small
        town northwest of Los Angeles, became the first American community to
        draw its electricity from a nuclear reactor. Moorpark’s power came from
        the Sodium Reactor Experiment, operated by the
        <span class="organization">Atomic Energy Commission</span> at the
        <span class="place">Santa Susana Field Laboratory</span> twenty miles
        away. The AEC—a precursor to today’s Department of Energy—invited
        <span class="person">Edward R. Murrow</span> to commemorate the event on
        his television show. “Enrico Fermi once looked at a reactor and said,
        ‘Wouldn’t it be wonderful if it could cure the common cold?’ ” intoned Murrow. “Here at Moorpark, a chain
        reaction that started with him washed the dishes and lit a book for a small boy to read.” No such lyrical
        announcement marked the day in July <span class="date">1959</span> when the plant’s coolant system failed and
        its uranium oxide fuel rods began melting down. With the reactor running out of control and set to explode,
        desperate operators deliberately released huge amounts of radioactive material into the air for nearly two
        weeks, making it almost certainly the most dangerous nuclear accident in U.S. history. The amount of iodine-131
        alone spewed into the southern California atmosphere was two hundred and sixty times that released at Three Mile
        Island, which is generally regarded as the worst ever U.S. nuclear disaster. None of this was revealed to the
        public, who were told merely that a “technical” fault had occurred, one that was “not an indication of unsafe
        reactor conditions.” As greater Los Angeles boomed in the following years, the area around the reactor
        site—originally chosen for its distance from population centers—was flooded with new residents. No one informed
        them of the astronomical levels of radioactive contaminants seeded deep in the soil.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, utilities were commissioning scores of nuclear plants across
        the country and promising electricity “too cheap to meter,” incentivized
        by the <span class="date">1957</span> <span class="quote">Price-Anderson Act</span>, which shifted
        financial liability in the event of a serious accident onto taxpayers.
        Rapid development throughout the Sixties engendered hopeful predictions
        from the AEC that more than a thousand reactors would be operating in
        the United States by the turn of the century. But it was not to be. As
        the environmental movement gathered strength in the Seventies, the
        dangers associated with nuclear power—from the routine disposal of
        radioactive waste to the risk of catastrophic meltdowns—galvanized a
        determined, informed, and organized opposition. Then, in <span class="date">1979</span>, one of
        two reactors at <span class="place">Three Mile Island</span> had a
        partial meltdown. Officials from the president on down issued soothing
        reassurances, downplaying the health risks. Negative assessments were
        discouraged; when the Pennsylvania state health secretary,
        <span class="person">Gordon MacLeod</span>, criticized the state’s
        response, he was promptly fired by the governor. MacLeod later revealed
        that child-mortality rates had doubled within a ten-mile radius of the
        plant. Cost overruns in plant construction, sometimes two times above
        industry estimates, were a further deterrent to expansion. Ultimately,
        more than 120 projects were canceled, and construction ground to a halt.
        “The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest
        managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental
        scale,” <span class="organization">Forbes magazine</span> commented in
        <span class="date">1985</span>, a year before Chernobyl. “Only the blind, or the biased, can now
        think that most of the money has been well spent.”

      <p>
        Amid the gloom, a distant ray of light for the industry began to
        flicker. On a hot day in June <span class="date">1988</span>, the NASA scientist
        <span class="person">James Hansen</span> told a packed Senate hearing,
        “with ninety-nine percent confidence,” that the earth’s temperature was
        at its warmest on record and that this was because of carbon dioxide
        emissions. By the following January, the New York Times was
        editorializing that the greenhouse effect is for real and calling for “a
        new generation of safer, cheaper nuclear power plants.” Later that year,
        <span class="person">Hans Blix</span>, the chairman of the
        <span class="organization">International Atomic Energy Agency</span>,
        told the United Nations that “the public should be aware that nuclear
        energy emits . . . no carbon dioxide whatever.” Given this assumption
        (which discounts the enormous quantities of carbon dioxide generated
        during plant construction), nuclear power’s high cost could be offset by
        rewarding its low emissions. One way to limit pollution is to put a
        price on it, a point not lost on at least one farsighted industry
        executive. In <span class="date">1992</span>, <span class="person">John Rowe</span>, then CEO of
        New England Electric System, which owned several nuclear plants in the
        region, began making the case for carbon pricing as a response to
        climate change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other partisans of nuclear power also recognized the relevance of
        climate alarms. This included <span class="person">Alex Flint</span>, a
        staffer for the New Mexico senator
        <span class="person">Pete Domenici</span>. Flint started working for
        Domenici as a teenager and eventually rose to a position overseeing the
        billion-dollar budgets of the nation’s nuclear weapons laboratories,
        including Los Alamos and Sandia. (Other Domenici staffers irreverently
        referred to his office as “the glow-in-the-dark team.”) By the
        mid-Nineties, Flint told me, scientists at the labs had convinced him
        “that the climate was changing, and we had a very serious problem.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In <span class="date">2000</span>, following a traditional trajectory for well-connected
        congressional staffers, he moved over to the private sector as a
        lobbyist and quickly recruited an impressive list of nuclear-industry
        clients, including <span class="company">Exelon Corporation</span>.
        <span class="person">John Rowe</span>, the apostle of carbon pricing,
        had just created Exelon by merging two giant utilities with extensive
        holdings in nuclear and coal plants. Rowe proceeded to sell off the coal
        operations, because, as he later explained, “I thought climate
        legislation would come sooner or later and that I’d rather have my money
        in the nuke fleet.” At the same time, Exelon spent heavily on lobbying
        in Washington. Within ten years of its founding, the company had
        invested more than $35 million in such efforts. Unfortunately for Rowe,
        the oil and gas industry had even deeper pockets and was viscerally
        opposed to any price penalty on its copious emissions. But Rowe’s
        investment still yielded gratifying returns, most notably in the <span class="date">2005</span>
        Energy Policy Act. The bill authorized $13 billion in tax credits, plus
        additional loan guarantees, for new commercial reactors. This enormous
        bounty was crafted by none other than Alex Flint, who had returned to
        public service as the staff director of the Senate Committee on Energy
        and Natural Resources. (He then moved back to private employ the
        following year to head the Nuclear Energy Institute’s governmental
        affairs office.) Money authorized under the act began to flow in <span class="date">2007</span>,
        when Congress appropriated $18 billion in loan guarantees for new
        reactors and another $4 billion for uranium enrichment. The largesse
        sparked hopes of a “nuclear renaissance” as utilities announced plans
        for new reactors.
      </p>

      <p>
        By then, climate change had moved to the forefront of public discussion.
        Obama spoke eloquently of the threat during his <span class="date">2008</span> campaign and urged
        a cap-and-trade initiative to curb carbon emissions. His close ties to
        Chicago-based Exelon were highlighted by bountiful campaign donations
        from Rowe and other executives, as well as the prior service of his
        chief strategist <span class="person">David Axelrod</span> as a
        consultant for the company. One Exelon lobbyist boasted of serving “the
        president’s utility.” But Exelon was not alone in securing presidential
        favor. In February <span class="date">2010</span>, Obama announced $8.3 billion in loan guarantees
        for two new reactors known as Vogtle 3 and 4, to be built in Burke
        County, Georgia. “We will not achieve a big boost in nuclear capacity,”
        declared the president, “unless we also create a system of incentives to
        make clean energy profitable.” As is traditional with the placement of
        such industrial facilities, the new reactors were to be constructed
        adjacent to a poor black community. The neighborhood, Shell Bluff, was
        already racked by cancers that residents ascribed to existing nuclear
        facilities. Not surprisingly, they vehemently opposed the project. “We
        voiced our opinion,” one local resident told CNN. “We didn’t want them,
        but we’re just the little peons.” The president, they said, “doesn’t
        know we’re down here.”

      <p>
        Eleven years later, the Vogtle plants are still under construction.
        Originally slated to be finished in <span class="date">2017</span>, they may now be ready in <span
          class="date">2023</span>.
        Costs have soared from $14 billion to $27 billion, a hefty slice of the
        overrun being borne by electricity customers in Georgia. Next door in
        South Carolina, ratepayers are still seeing onerous supplements on their
        monthly bills for two plants that were abandoned in <span class="date">2017</span> because of
        soaring costs and the bankruptcy of the main contractor. In November
        <span class="date">2020</span>, <span class="person">Kevin Marsh</span>, the former CEO of the
        South Carolina utility SCANA, pled guilty to fraud in concealing the $9
        billion cost of the uncompleted reactors. He is now serving a two-year
        prison sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Passing off additional costs to utility customers would appear to be a
        standard business model. It tends to require the complaisance of state
        legislators, who can demand and receive a high price for their
        favors—unseemly transactions that call into question the notion of
        “clean” nuclear energy. In November <span class="date">2016</span>, senior executives at Ohio’s
        <span class="organization">FirstEnergy</span> hatched plans to shunt
        more of the operating costs of their two nuclear plants onto individual
        customers. As later detailed by an FBI criminal complaint, the scheme
        involved lubricating the election of a cooperative Republican legislator
        named <span class="person">Larry Householder</span> as speaker of the
        Ohio House of Representatives. To this end, $61 million moved via a
        series of dark money cutouts to Householder, who used the funds both for
        personal needs and for financing his campaign and those of allies who
        could supply the necessary votes for the rate increase. It proved a
        sound investment. Householder was duly elected speaker and proceeded to
        pass a bill in <span class="date">2019</span>, with bipartisan support, that authorized $1 billion
        in rate supplements to bail out the company’s two Ohio plants. (One of
        these, Davis-Besse, outside Toledo, has a hair-raising safety record,
        including a hole in the reactor vessel and cracks in its concrete
        containment shell.) Although the bill canceled existing mandates for
        renewable energy, proponents were eloquent in their concern for the
        climate. Representative <span class="person">Jamie Callender</span>, for
        example, who got just under $25,000 from FirstEnergy and served as a
        primary sponsor of the bill, spoke piously of the need to encourage
        “zero carbon emissions.” A FirstEnergy spokesman applauded Callender and
        other sponsors “for their efforts in recognizing the important and vital
        role nuclear energy, along with many other clean energy sources, plays
        in providing clean, safe, and reliable carbon-free energy to Ohioans.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately for the plotters, the FBI had monitored their
        deliberations. Following disclosure of the bribery scheme, public
        outrage led to a repeal of the bailout. Householder, indicted along with
        four associates, denies the charges and has yet to go to trial.
        <span class="organization">FirstEnergy</span>, none of whose employees
        faced criminal charges, agreed to a $230 million fine, and its
        generating unit was spun off under the name Energy Harbor. (“We call it
        Pirates’ Cove,” joked the Toledo attorney
        <span class="person">Terry Lodge</span>, who has been litigating cases
        related to Davis-Besse since <span class="date">1979</span>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        While <span class="company">Energy Harbor</span> saw its scheme
        collapse, <span class="company">Exelon</span> has suffered no such
        setback in pursuit of bailouts through similar means. A federal
        investigation revealed that an Exelon subsidiary lavished favors in the
        form of jobs and contracts on associates of Illinois House Speaker
        <span class="person">Mike Madigan</span>, long the most powerful
        politician in the state, and was rewarded with beneficial legislation,
        most notably a $2.35 billion subsidy enacted in <span class="date">2016</span>, for two
        money-losing reactors that the company had discussed closing. The
        subsidiary agreed to pay a $200 million fine, which was more than
        balanced by the $694 million subsidy signed into law by
        <span class="person">J. B. Pritzker</span> in September <span class="date">2021</span>, a response
        to Exelon’s threats to close two other aging plants—one of which appears
        to have generated a significant cancer cluster in its neighborhood.
        Though the Sierra Club opposes nuclear energy, the Illinois chapter
        supported that legislation because of the measures it included to phase
        out coal and gas sources. The Illinois bailout is far eclipsed, however,
        by the federal largesse promised by the Biden Administration’s
        infrastructure and climate legislation. An analysis by the
        <span class="organization">Nuclear Information and Resource Service</span>
        suggests that 54 percent of the $41 billion will be split between just
        three companies, with Exelon set to receive $15 billion. (<span class="company">Energy Harbor</span>
        is the runner-up, with $5 billion.)
      </p>

      <p>
        For all the hopeful talk about new technology, however, the industry’s
        principal concern is to keep aging reactors running long after their
        original life spans, even where this poses serious safety risks. In a
        process known as embrittlement, for example, vital components such as
        containment vessels crack following decades of neutron bombardment,
        leading to the release of lethal radiation. Nonetheless, the
        <span class="organization">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span> appears
        happy to grant extensions: plants originally designed to last forty
        years are being authorized to run for sixty or eighty in total.
        <span class="company">Point Beach 2</span>, a reactor on Lake Michigan
        that the NRC itself listed in <span class="date">2013</span> among the most embrittled plants in
        the country, is applying to be relicensed to operate for eighty years.
        The reactor and its twin, <span class="company">Point Beach 1</span>,
        have been cited for safety violations and equipment malfunctions more
        than 130 times. At the NRC, there is even discussion of allowing plants
        to run for a century, long after their designers and builders are dead.
        “None of these extreme extensions have addressed critical ‘knowledge
        gaps’ for the reliability of major irreplaceable and inaccessible
        systems,” said <span class="person">Paul Gunter</span> of
        <span class="organization">Beyond Nuclear</span>, a tireless watchdog
        group working to challenge the extensions. In his view, the industry is
        being allowed to head blindly into the unknown, with no idea how or when
        age-related cracking and embrittlement will lead to component failure
        and potential meltdown.

        Prosperous and 70 percent white,
        <span class="place">West Hills, California</span>, is one of the
        communities that have sprouted near the
        <span class="place">Santa Susana Field Laboratory</span> in the decades
        since the <span class="date">1959</span> meltdown. Unlike the poor, sick, and embittered residents
        of <span class="place">Shell Bluff</span>, people living in
        <span class="place">West Hills</span> had until recently only the barest
        inkling that nuclear power in the neighborhood might have had unwelcome
        consequences. “Almost no one knew about the Santa Susana Field Lab, or
        they thought it was an urban legend,”
        <span class="person">Melissa Bumstead</span>, who grew up in nearby
        <span class="place">Thousand Oaks</span>, told me recently. In <span class="date">2014</span>,
        Bumstead’s four-year-old daughter, Grace, was diagnosed with an
        aggressive form of leukemia. “This has no environmental link,” her
        pediatric oncologist told her firmly. Childhood cancers were rare, and
        this was just cruel luck. Then, while taking Grace to
        <span class="place">Children’s Hospital Los Angeles</span>, Bumstead ran
        into a woman who recognized her from the local park where their young
        daughters played. The woman’s child had neuroblastoma, another rare
        cancer, as did another from nearby
        <span class="place">Simi Valley</span>, whom they encountered while the
        children were getting chemo. Back at home, someone on her street noticed
        the childhood cancer awareness sticker on Bumstead’s car and mentioned
        that another neighbor had died of cancer as a teenager. Bumstead began
        to draw a map detailing the cluster of cancer deaths in small children
        just in the previous six years, but stopped working on it in <span class="date">2017</span>. “I
        had such severe PTSD when I added children onto it, my therapist told me
        to stop.” But it is still happening, she said, mentioning the unusual
        number of bald children she had noticed in local elementary schools in
        recent years, as well as the far-above-average rate of breast cancer
        cases recorded in the area. A cleanup of the field lab was due to be
        completed in <span class="date">2017</span>, but it has yet to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        I called Bumstead because I had been struck by the fact that
        TerraPower’s Natrium reactor resembles in its basic features the
        long-ago Sodium Reactor Experiment at
        <span class="place">Santa Susana</span>. (Natrium is Latin for sodium.)
        “That’s exactly what we had!” Bumstead exclaimed when I mentioned that
        liquid sodium is integral to TerraPower’s project. “The meltdown was in
        the sodium reactor.” As her comment made clear, such liquid sodium
        technology is by no means innovative. Nor, in an extensive history of
        experiments, has it ever proved popular—not least because liquid sodium
        explodes when it comes into contact with water, and burns when exposed
        to air. In addition, it is highly corrosive to metal, which is one
        reason the technology was rapidly abandoned by the U.S. Navy after a
        tryout in the Seawolf submarine in <span class="date">1957</span>. That system “was leaking before
        it even left the dock on its first voyage,” recalls
        <span class="person">Foster Blair</span>, a longtime senior engineer
        with the Navy’s reactor program. The Navy eventually encased the reactor
        in steel and dropped it into the sea 130 miles off the coast of
        Maryland, with the assurance that the container would not corrode while
        the contents were still radioactive. The main novelty of the Natrium
        reactor is a tank that stores molten salt, which can drive steam
        generators to produce extra power when demand surges. “Interesting
        idea,” Blair commented. “But from an engineering standpoint one that has
        some real potential problems, namely the corrosion of the
        high-temperature salt in just about any metal container over any period
        of time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        TerraPower’s <span class="person">Jeff Navin</span> assured me in
        response that Natrium “is designed to be a safe, cost-effective
        commercial reactor.” He added that Natrium’s use of uranium-based metal
        fuel would increase the reactor’s safety and performance. Blair told me
        that such a system had been tried and abandoned in the Fifties because
        the solid fuel swelled and grew after fissioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a March <span class="date">2021</span> report for the
        <span class="organization">Union of Concerned Scientists</span>, the
        physicist <span class="person">Edwin Lyman</span> likewise concluded
        that there was little evidence that reactor designs like Natrium’s would
        be safer than water-cooled models. “When I read about many of the
        current proposals,” <span class="person">Blair</span> said, “it is
        almost as if they are unaware of all the work that has gone before.”
        Citing the Navy’s abandonment of sodium reactors, he suggested that
        companies such as <span class="organization">TerraPower</span> “are
        unaware, or intentionally choose to ignore history.” He recalled that
        Admiral <span class="person">Hyman Rickover</span>, who ran the Navy’s
        nuclear program for three decades, would personally command the sea
        trials of every new nuclear submarine. In that spirit, he suggested,
        “they should only license a small modular reactor on condition that the
        head of the corporation that built it takes up permanent residence
        within a quarter mile of the plant.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As the sodium saga indicates, the true history of nuclear energy is
        largely unknown to all but specialists, which is ironic given that it
        keeps repeating itself. The story of
        <span class="place">Santa Susana</span> follows the same path as more
        famous disasters, most strikingly in the studious indifference of those
        in charge to signs of impending catastrophe. The operators at
        <span class="place">Santa Susana</span> shrugged off evidence of
        problems with the cooling system for weeks prior to the meltdown, and
        even restarted the reactor after initial trouble. Soviet nuclear
        authorities covered up at least one accident at
        <span class="place">Chernobyl</span> before the disaster and ignored
        warnings that the reactor was dangerously unsafe. The
        <span class="place">Fukushima</span> plant’s designers didn’t account
        for the known risk of massive tsunamis, a vulnerability augmented by
        inadequate safety precautions that were overlooked by regulators.
        Automatic safety features at <span class="place">Santa Susana</span> did
        not work. This was also the case at
        <span class="place">Fukushima</span>, where vital backup generators were
        destroyed by the tidal wave.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one knows exactly how much radiation was released by
        <span class="place">Santa Susana</span>—it exceeded the scale of the
        monitors. Nor was there any precise accounting of the radioactivity
        released at <span class="place">Chernobyl</span>.
        <span class="place">Fukushima</span> emitted far less, yet the prime
        minister of <span class="place">Japan</span> prepared plans to evacuate
        fifty million people, which would have meant, as he later recounted, the
        end of <span class="place">Japan</span> as a functioning state. Another
        common thread is the attempt by overseers, both corporate and
        governmental, to conceal information from the public for as long as
        possible. <span class="place">Santa Susana</span> holds the prize in
        this regard: its coverup was sustained for twenty years, until students
        at <span class="organization">UCLA</span> found the truth in
        <span class="organization">Atomic Energy Commission</span> documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most striking of all is the success of official campaigns asserting that
        even the most serious accidents have caused little or no harm. The
        spectacular scale of the <span class="place">Chernobyl</span> disaster,
        with its mass evacuations and radioactive clouds wafting across borders,
        made it difficult to downplay health effects. Yet, as
        <span class="person">Kate Brown</span>, a historian of science at
        <span class="organization">MIT</span>, details in
        <i>Manual for Survival: An Environmental History of the Chernobyl
          Disaster</i>, the
        <span class="organization">International Atomic Energy Agency</span> and
        the <span class="organization">World Health Organization</span> helped
        promote the notion that the disaster’s health effects had been minimal.
        In <span class="date">2005</span>, the UN settled on a figure of 4,000 deaths among those most
        exposed in <span class="place">Ukraine</span>,
        <span class="place">Belarus</span>, and
        <span class="place">Russia</span>—a number at the low end of a
        strikingly wide range, <span class="person">Brown</span> observed. The
        <span class="organization">IAEA</span> had earlier reported “no health
        disorders that could be attributed directly to radiation exposure.” It
        was only when <span class="person">Keith Baverstock</span>, a scientist
        with the <span class="organization">World Health Organization</span>,
        defied a superior and publicly disclosed a sharp increase in extremely
        rare thyroid cancers among
        <span class="place">Belarusian</span> children that there was some
        grudging acceptance of the disaster’s deadly consequences. Even so,
        <span class="person">Baverstock</span> says, he was threatened with
        firing unless he withdrew his findings; others in receipt of WHO funding
        claimed the jump in cases was merely the result of intensified
        screening.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="person">Brown</span> spent ten years in archives across
        <span class="place">Ukraine</span>, <span class="place">Belarus</span>,
        and <span class="place">Russia</span>, disinterring records of what
        happened to the millions of people exposed not only to the invisible
        cloud, but to its residue in the landscape from which they drew their
        food. That residue had global reach—a truck carrying Ukrainian
        blueberries to the United States from Canada was so radioactive it was
        stopped at the border. Traveling around affected areas, some far from
        the plant itself, <span class="person">Brown</span> encountered evidence
        of communities shredded by radiation, such as women who sorted wool from
        sheep slaughtered in the radiation zone. Toting bales of radioactive
        wool, <span class="person">Brown</span> has said, “was like hugging an
        X-ray machine while it was turned on over and over again.” Many got sick
        and died. Yet amid the tens of thousands of pages
        <span class="person">Brown</span> perused, just one obscure official
        document furnished a hard figure for
        <span class="place">Chernobyl</span>-related deaths: 36,525. That was
        the number of women in <span class="place">Ukraine</span> who received
        pensions because their husbands had died as a result of the disaster—a
        toll far in excess of anything reported by Western officials. But that
        stark number must represent only a small fraction of the total. “That’s
        just <span class="place">Ukraine</span>,” she told me, “which received
        only 20 percent of the radiation. There’s no comparable figure for
        <span class="place">Belarus</span>, which got far more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        While <span class="person">Brown</span> mined records of
        <span class="place">Chernobyl</span>’s effects on humans,
        <span class="person">Timothy Mousseau</span> of the
        <span class="place">University of South Carolina</span> and his Danish
        colleague <span class="person">Anders Møller</span> spent decades
        studying its consequences on the landscape around the plant. “It’s not a
        complete void of life. It’s much more insidious than that,”
        <span class="person">Mousseau</span> told <i>Harper’s Magazine</i> in
        <span class="date">2011</span>. “Because everything’s still there, it’s just being modified at
        some low level.” Birds, animals, and plants suffer the baneful effects
        of radiation to some degree. Early on,
        <span class="person">Mousseau</span> was struck by the near absence of
        spiderwebs, normally abundant in forests. Studying the area around
        <span class="place">Fukushima</span>, he saw many of the same results.
        This conclusion was not popular with the
        <span class="place">Japanese</span> authorities. “One reason we don’t
        know as much about <span class="place">Fukushima</span> as we should,”
        he told me, “is that the <span class="place">Japanese</span>—the
        government, academia, the corporation, it’s all the same thing—really
        discouraged research. I was certainly pressured not to publish my
        findings. It was in the form of sticks and carrots, carrots being,
        ‘Wouldn’t it be nice to have an institute for studies of
        <span class="place">Fukushima</span>, and by the way, you really don’t
        want to publish those papers that you’ve written recently.’” He
        published them anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        In light of the evidence of post-<span class="place">Chernobyl</span>
        thyroid cancer, researchers mounted a major effort to screen children in
        the area around <span class="place">Fukushima</span>. Year after year,
        the numbers steadily ratcheted up, eventually reaching twenty times
        normal levels. (As with thyroid cancer in
        <span class="place">Belarus</span>, officials from UN agencies claimed
        the rise in cases was merely the result of intensified screening.)
        Meanwhile, local authorities began a campaign to discourage children
        from getting screened, advising them of “the right not to know.” The
        campaign had some success, and the number of participating children
        dropped. Not coincidentally, from <span class="date">2016</span> on, the number of reported child
        thyroid cases started to decline.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The right not to know” about the effects of nuclear power is currently
        embraced far beyond <span class="place">Fukushima</span>. In the face of
        escalating alarm about climate change, the siren song of “clean and
        affordable and reliable” power finds an audience eager to overlook a
        business model that is dependent on state support and often greased with
        corruption; failed experiments now hailed as “innovative”; a pattern of
        artful disinformation; and a trail of poison from accidents and leaks
        (not to mention the 95,000 tons of radioactive waste currently stored at
        reactor sites with nowhere to go) that will affect generations yet
        unborn. Arguments by proponents of renewables that wind, solar, and
        geothermal power can fill the gap on their own have found little
        traction with policymakers. Ignoring history, we may be condemned to
        repeat it. <span class="person">Bill Gates</span> has bet a billion
        dollars on that.
