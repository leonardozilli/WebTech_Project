            <h3>16th Century Style</h3>
            <p>This style was inspired by the <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible"><span class="geneva" id="geneva" data-coord="46.201667,6.146944">Geneva</span> Bible</span>, one of the most historically significant, widely read and influential translations of the Bible into English, preceding the <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version">King James Version</span> by 51 years. Published for the first time in <span class="tag date 1560">1560</span>, it was the  primary Bible of the 16th century English Protestantism, deemed to be the first "Study Bible" and was the one used and cited countless times by the likes of <span class="tag person william_shakespeare" id="william_shakespeare" data-name="William Shakespeare", data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</span>, <span class="tag person john_bunyan" id="john_bunyan" data-name="John Bunyan" data-name="John Bunyan" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bunyan">John Bunyan</span> and <span class="tag person john_milton" id="john_milton" data-name="John Milton" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton">John Milton</span>.</p>
            <p>The Geneva Bible is unique among all other Bibles for it offered a number of radical never-before-seen changes: it was the first Bible in English to add numbered verses, and it was also the first to include extensive commentary notes and study guides intended to help explain and interpret the Scriptures for the average reader. These aids were not only scriptural studies, but also included cross-reference verse citations, introductions to each book of the Bible, maps, tables, woodcut illustrations and indexes among other features.</p>
            <h5>Layout</h5>
            <p>The Geneva Bible was first issued in a <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto">quarto</span> format, but later alternative editions were also issued in a pocketable <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavo">octavo</span> and a larger <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</span> versions. Following this formatting idea, both the homepage and the reading view of the application have been developed with this concept in mind, the former spanning only exactly half the viewport's length and the the latter which presents itself as halved in two exact portions, the left one portraying the text of the article currently reading and the right portion (or "page", if you will) housing the "study aids" for the text in the form of an interactive map, the wikipedia portal and the alphabetically ordered indexes of the metadata.</p>
            <h6>Homepage</h6>
            <p>As previously stated, the homepage takes up exactly half of the screen's estate width-wise to reflect the folio layout. Several embellishments have been inserted as decoration to the page; these have been extracted directly from the pages of the Geneva Bible. </p>
            <h6>Article view</h6>
            <p>The header has been positioned to the left of the screen, as to not reduce the already busy height-wise areas of the text and metadata portions and permit a more comfortable reading experience for the reader.</p>

            <h5>Typography</h5>
            <p>For what concerns the typography, the Geneva was the first Bible to introduce the easier-to-read “Roman Style Typeface” rather than the “Gothic Blackletter Style Typeface” which had been used exclusively in earlier Bibles. 
                With its variety of scriptural study guides and aids—which included cross-reference verse citations, introductions to each book of the Bible, maps, tables, woodcut illustrations, indexes, and other features—the Geneva Bible is regarded as history's first study Bible.</p>

            <h3>The Pulps</h3>


            <p>Pulp magazines were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from the 1890s to the 1960s. The name is inspired by the cheap pulp paper on which they were printed. They included short novels and serial novels in their content. They were mostly known for their sensational and low-quality stories, even though many relevant authors published on them.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>Since the number of publication featuring in this editorial genre includes a wide pletora of publications spreading over seventy years, we have decide to range down our reference, focusing on the so-called big "Big Four" (Argosy, Adventure, Blue Book and Short Stories) Love Story and Amazing Stories, and selecting only publications from the 1928 To 1934, the golden age of the genre. The reference file may be found in <a href="#table">here</a></p>

            <h5> paper size</h5>
            <p>It is known that the main paper size for this publications was 10 inches over 7 inches (so-called executive), athough none of the file used to drag inspiration were stored with any ruler. To obtain it the ratio between the file sizes was calculated as in <a href="#table">here</a>. All of them can be rounded to the one of the executive paper, so we assumed that all this publications used the aforementioned paper size. This information was used to define the maximum width of the page and calculate all the measures proportioned to it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">  
            <h5>The layout</h5>
            <p>As described in <a href="#table">here</a> This type of publications shows similar behaviors in terms of layout. What emerges is that the design of the pagination of them was driven by a cummon logic of saving up space. In fact, it should not be forgotten that this publication were serial and were meant for a generalist public, so they had to keep prices low to be profitable. This result in a very “crowded” layout, where the small spaces are reduced to the minimum amount. Moreover the layout in the majority of the cases follows a grid-like display, dividing in almost all the cases the content in two columns, and using rulers to make the separation explicit where the space it is not sufficient.</p>
            <p>All this general reflections have been then integrated with a direct analysis of the page. We converted the measurements obtained in pt, to obtain an absolute value. This proportions were calculated finding the ratio between the measures on the file (in inches) and the 10 inches converted in cm. All the measures calculated on the file for all the measures shown in. It must be specified that this measures have been strictly respected throughout the website.</p>
            <p>Finally, we wanted to transmit the sense of inexpensiveness of the product using a vary basic web layout, where the structure can transmit a sens of low-budget.</p>

            <h5>The fonts</h5>
            <p>for what concerned with the fonts choosing, the <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont">What the font</a> AI was used to individuate those of the cover pages in the original file. The names can be seen in <a href="#table">here</a>. It was not possibile to find an open source of them, so we opted for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Jost, sans serif</b>Jost, sans serif for buttons, as the fonts used in many covers for smaller contents;</li>
                    <li><b>Rametto One, sans serif;</b> inspired to <i>Love Story</i> heading;</li>
                    <li><b>Glouchester Old Style, serif</b> for the subheading as in <i>Argosy</i></li>
                    <li><b>Copper black regular</b> as in the content table of <i>Love Story</i></li>
                    <li><b>Theano Old Style</b> for header and bodyd, as the font used in <i>Amazing Stories</i> </li>
                    <li><b>Wichinta Serial bold</b> for the date as in <i>Argosy</i></li>


                </ul> 
            <p>The body, Theano Old Style was chosen after many analysis. It must be said that this font has many characteristics typographic characteristic, which make it the best option. Although it does not have an italic version, which was integrated with <b>Goudy Old Style</b>.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h3>1990s Style</h3>
            <p>The 1990s style was largely inspired by the work of <span class="tag person david_carson" id="david_carson" data-name="David Carson" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carson_(graphic_designer)">David Carson</span>, a pioneer in graphic design and surely one the most influential designers of the nineties. Nicknamed the “Godfather of Grunge”, Carson pioneered the use of distressed textures, layered backgrounds, and distinctively rough layouts and is seen as one of the most prominent figures that helped popularizing the grunge style, one of the defining styles of the time period.</p>
            <p>His style, known for pushing boundaries and challenging traditional design norms, is characterized by the use of deconstructive techniques that bend the rules of typography and layout resulting in very aggressive designs that push the laws of the discipline to the extreme. <span class="tag person david_carson">Carson</span>’s work challenged the fundamental criteria for legibility by exploring elements such as reverse reading, extreme forced justification, and collage art styles.</p>
            <p>Perhaps his most famous effort, <span class="tag person david_carson">Carson</span> was the art director for the magazine <span class="tag other" data-wiki="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Gun_(magazine)">Ray Gun</span>, an American alternative rock-and-roll and lifestyle magazine that explored experimental magazine typographic design and unique angles on the pop cultural currents of the 1990s. The editorial content was framed in a chaotic, abstract "grunge typography" style, not always readable but distinctive in appearance.</p>

            <p>To reflect this stylistic approach to typography, a number of different fonts have been used in the creation of this style. The biggest challenge in trying to replicate <span class="tag person david_carson">Carson</span>'s distinctive style lies in the "diy" approach that he had to typography, often mixing up multiple different fonts to come up with something totally new. An example of this has been used on the website thanks to the "Times New Arial" font, a mashup of Times New Roman and Arial, that combines two very different fonts coming from two typographical families, serif and sans serif, in one original typeface. The majority of the fonts, apart from the text of the article, has been given a slight degree of rotation to simulate the diy nature of <span class="tag person david_carson">Carson</span>'s works.</p>

        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>This theme is a bit critic. The reasoning of this style takes its move from some of the latest technologies developed and under development in recent years, such as the smart glasses developed by Google and Meta, the futristic TVs by LG Transparent OLED. And the AR devices like Apple Vision Pro. All this new devices which is imaged that will take over the market in futures years share a cummon element, the transparency of the device itself. Then, the future that is imaged here sees how we think megazines might adapt to this technology.</p>

        <p>we have taken in consideration the problem of attention tha could eventually emerge by the usage of this devices. We considered that, allowing to see behind the content displayed, it could be possibile that the users might result in being overstimulated by such a resource, leading to lower levels of attention in the content.</p>
        <h3>The usage context</h3>
        <p>the first aspect that was taken in consideration in developing this new tool was the context of usage. We imaged two main cases of usage: sat and on-movement. In the first case, the user is not moving coring the usage. This allows them to use the device fool screen. On the onther hand, imagining the devise to be used in a moving situation, it requires to leave the majority of display empty. There fore we have imaginesd the visualization to be resized according to the condition of experience of user.</p>

        <div class="text-block"></div>
        <h5>The layout</h5>
        <p>The layout of this theme is based on the idea of exaggerating some characteristics of modern websites, imaging that in future the already-in-act standardization in layouts will be even more enphasised by the lost of the background in transparent devices.</p>
        <p>For what concern the layout, we tried to emphasise the attention that nowadays websites gives to white spaces. This can be noticed mainly in the home page, where each section takes up the whole height of the view part. Moreover, For defining our proportion, we decided to use the scaling based on multiples of 6; all the fonts, the margins and the padding where realised like this.</p>
        <p>We decided to limitate the number of animations to only a few cases and mostly when dealing with a full size display. We believe that the presence of many animations might be dangerous once the user is walking around. Also, this characteristic highlight the standardized appearance of the web page </p>
        <h5>Fonts</h5>
        <p>The choosing of the fonts was driven by the type of experience that we are imagining for our user. The basis idea is that, once using one of this devices, the human brain always has two layers to look at simultaneously. This characteristics, leads to a reduced cognitive attention to the content of the articles. Moreover, the rising trend of <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-color-gray-tiktok-color-trend-study">minimalistic</a> <a href="https://www.printmag.com/design-trends/black-and-white-logo-design-trend/">logos and websites</a>. Brought us to imagine this futuristic theme using very basic fonts, on one hand for increasing <a href="https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&context=university_honors_program">readability</a>, on the other to reproduce this minimalistic aesthetic.</p>
        <p>based on our research we have defined as best souting fonts Montserrat for main text, for its letter-spacing and the absence of serifs. Then we decided to use Haettenschweiler as it is considered a <a href="https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&context=university_honors_program">difficult font</a> and particular fonts increase cognitive retention.</p>
        <p>The initial idea was to use e more particular font for the headings, then we thought to translate the general tendency of logos to resemble one another using this font:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Montserrat</b> for main text;</li>
            <li><b>Archivo</b> for headings;</li>
            <li><b>Haettenschweiler</b> for metadata;</li>
            <li><b>Pirulen RG</b> for main header.</li>
        </ul>
